# Camera Coordinate & Calibration Contract (CAM-0b)

**Status:** Spec / recon proposal. No production code is defined here.
**Scope:** Define the minimal coordinate-frame and camera-calibration contract
that CAM-1 (camera-based star matching) needs before implementation begins.
**Audience:** Whoever implements CAM-1 and its supporting core module.

This document is the CAM-0b deliverable. It builds on:

- `docs/star_catalog_ptskcat0_format.md` — the PTSKCAT0 real-star catalog
  format (CAT-1).
- `docs/real_star_visibility_contract.md` — the `RealStarVisibilityService`
  visible-star selection (VF-1) and its VF-2a renderer adapter.
- The CAM-0a code inventory. No standalone CAM-0a document exists in the
  repository, so §0 below folds the relevant inventory into this spec so that
  every claim about "existing code" is grounded in a concrete file.

It deliberately does **not** implement camera matching. It specifies the
frames, the transform chain, the intrinsics contract, the sync contract, and
the CAM-1 input/output data models, then recommends a first implementation
slice.

## 0. CAM-0a inventory (existing camera / AR / projection / sensor code)

Everything CAM-1 will build on already exists as the **AR overlay** pipeline
in `:mobile`, plus the astronomy transforms in `:core:astro-core`. The table
is the ground truth for the rest of this document.

| Concern | File | Key symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Camera preview | `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/CameraPreview.kt` | `CameraPreview` — CameraX `Preview` only, `PreviewView.ScaleType.FILL_CENTER`, `DEFAULT_BACK_CAMERA` |
| Sensor attitude | `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/RotationFrame.kt` | `RotationFrame`, `rememberRotationFrame()` (`TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`, `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME`), `correctedForTrueNorth()`, `deviceRollDegrees()` |
| Display remap | `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/DisplayRemap.kt` | `remapForDisplay()` (`SensorManager.remapCoordinateSystem`) |
| Projection + overlay | `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/ArScreen.kt` | `calculateOverlay()`, `projectDeviceVector()`, `projectionParams()`, `horizontalToVector()`, `vectorToHorizontal()`, `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` |
| Overlay models | `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/AstroOverlayModels.kt` | `ScreenLineSegment`, `OverlayData`, star/asterism overlays |
| AR view model | `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/ArViewModel.kt` | `ArViewModel`, `ArUiState.Ready`, `ArStar` |
| Eq↔Hor transform | `core/astro-core/src/main/kotlin/dev/pointtosky/core/astro/transform/EquatorialHorizontalTransform.kt` | `raDecToAltAz()`, `altAzToRaDec()`, `Meteo` |
| Sidereal time | `core/astro-core/src/main/kotlin/dev/pointtosky/core/astro/time/SiderealTime.kt` | `gmstDeg()`, `lstDeg()`, `lstAt()` |
| Coordinate types | `core/astro-core/src/main/kotlin/dev/pointtosky/core/astro/coord/Coordinates.kt` | `Equatorial`, `Horizontal`, `GeoPoint`, `Sidereal` |
| Angular separation | `core/astro-core/src/main/kotlin/dev/pointtosky/core/astro/identify/Identify.kt` | `angularSeparationDeg()`, `IdentifySolver.findBest()` |
| Real catalog (CAT-1) | `core/catalog/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/core/catalog/binary/PtskCat0Catalog.kt` | `PtskCat0Catalog` (struct-of-arrays: `raDegAt/decDegAt/magAt/bvAt/hipAt/nameAt`) |
| Visible set (VF-1) | `core/catalog/src/main/kotlin/dev/pointtosky/core/catalog/visibility/RealStarVisibilityService.kt` | `select(SkyQualityInput): RealStarVisibilityResult` |
| Visible adapter (VF-2a) | `core/catalog/src/main/kotlin/dev/pointtosky/core/catalog/visibility/render/VisibleRealStarSnapshot.kt` | `VisibleRealStar`, `VisibleRealStarSnapshot`, `VisibleRealStarProvider` |

**Critical inventory findings that shape this spec:**

1. **There is no camera-image pipeline.** `CameraPreview` binds only a CameraX
   `Preview` surface. There is **no** `ImageAnalysis`, no `ImageProxy`, no
   pixel buffer, and no frame timestamp reaching Kotlin. A grep for
   `CameraCharacteristics`, `ImageAnalysis`, `LENS_INFO`, `SENSOR_INFO`, and
   `imageInfo` across the whole tree returns nothing.
   **Updated by CAM-1c:** `CameraPreview` now also binds an `ImageAnalysis`
   use case and a frame-metadata-only pipeline exists — see §4.4. Pixel
   buffers are still never read anywhere in the tree; only metadata
   (`imageInfo.timestamp`, `width`/`height`, `imageInfo.rotationDegrees`,
   `cropRect`) reaches Kotlin.
2. **The projection uses a hardcoded FOV**, not the real lens:
   `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` (`ArScreen.kt:1276`), with horizontal FOV derived
   from the *viewport* aspect ratio (`projectionParams`, `ArScreen.kt:1201`).
3. **The overlay is aligned to the display viewport, not the camera image.**
   Projection maps to Compose `Offset` pixels over `overlaySize` (the AR
   `Box`), while `PreviewView` uses `FILL_CENTER`, which center-crops the
   camera frame by an unknown scale. The overlay currently "works" only
   because both the preview and the overlay fill the same box; the actual
   camera→display crop/scale is never modeled. This is the single biggest gap
   for pixel-accurate star matching.

## 1. Coordinate frames

Six frames participate. For each: definition, units, axis convention,
handedness, and where it lives in code today.

### 1.1 Catalog frame — equatorial J2000 (RA/Dec)

- **Type:** `Equatorial(raDeg, decDeg)`
  (`core/astro-core/.../coord/Coordinates.kt:9`).
- **Units:** RA `0°..360°`, Dec `-90°..+90°`, decimal degrees.
- **Epoch:** J2000 (PTSKCAT0 header `Epoch = 2000`;
  `docs/star_catalog_ptskcat0_format.md`). Catalog carries **no proper
  motion** and **no per-record epoch** — a single global J2000.
- **Source:** `PtskCat0Catalog.raDegAt(i)/decDegAt(i)` for CAT-1; VF-2a's
  `VisibleRealStar.raDeg/decDeg` for the visible subset.
- **Handedness:** right-handed celestial sphere; RA increases eastward.

### 1.2 Observer frame — horizontal (Alt/Az)

- **Type:** `Horizontal(azDeg, altDeg)` (`Coordinates.kt:20`).
- **Units:** Az `0°..360°` **clockwise from geographic North**; Alt
  `-90°..+90°` above the horizon.
- **Depends on:** observer `GeoPoint(latDeg, lonDeg)` and local sidereal time
  `Sidereal(lstDeg)`.
- **Source:** `raDecToAltAz(eq, lstDeg, latDeg, applyRefraction, meteo)`.
- **Handedness note:** azimuth is a *compass* angle (clockwise), not a
  math-positive (counter-clockwise) angle. Every conversion to/from a Cartesian
  vector must respect this.

### 1.3 Device / world frame — Android ENU

- **Definition:** the "world" frame produced by
  `SensorManager.getRotationMatrixFromVector` after `remapForDisplay`. It is
  **ENU**: `+X = East`, `+Y = North`, `+Z = Up (away from Earth centre)`.
  Right-handed.
- **North caveat:** the rotation vector's Y axis points at **magnetic**
  North. True North is obtained by rotating about `+Z` by the magnetic
  declination — see `RotationFrame.correctedForTrueNorth()`
  (`RotationFrame.kt:107`), which mirrors the watch's
  `Horizontal.toTrueNorth`.
- **Alt/Az ↔ ENU vector** (in `ArScreen.kt:1249`,
  `horizontalToVector`):
  `v = (cosAlt·sinAz, cosAlt·cosAz, sinAlt)` → confirms `X=East, Y=North,
  Z=Up`, `az = atan2(x, y)`.
- **Matrix:** `RotationFrame.rotationMatrix` is **device→world** (row-major
  3×3). Its transpose is **world→device**.

### 1.4 Camera frame — device axes after display remap

- **Definition:** the phone's own axes as re-expressed for the current display
  rotation by `remapForDisplay` (`DisplayRemap.kt`). Convention used by the
  projector (`projectDeviceVector`, `ArScreen.kt:1210`):
  `+X = screen right`, `+Y = screen up`, `+Z = out of the screen toward the
  user`. The **camera looks along −Z**.
- **Camera forward:** `forwardWorld = (−m[2], −m[5], −m[8])`
  (`RotationFrame.kt:62`) — the third column of device→world negated, i.e. the
  world direction the back camera points at.
- **Assumption baked in:** the optical axis is treated as exactly the device
  `−Z` axis, and the lens is assumed to be co-axial and non-tilted relative to
  the IMU. Any camera-to-IMU extrinsic offset is currently zero. (Acceptable
  for CAM-1 MVP; see §3.)

### 1.5 Image pixel frame — camera sensor image

- **Current status: does not exist in code.** No image buffer is delivered, so
  there is no image-pixel frame today.
- **Intended definition for CAM-1:** integer pixel `(u, v)` over the analyzed
  camera frame, origin top-left, `+u` right, `+v` down, resolution =
  `ImageProxy` width/height (after any analyzer rotation). Principal point
  `(cx, cy)` ≈ image centre unless intrinsics say otherwise.
- This frame is where detected bright points (if used) and projected star
  predictions must be compared for matching.

### 1.6 Display / screen frame — Compose pixels

- **Type:** Compose `Offset(x, y)` in device-independent pixels, origin
  top-left, `+x` right, `+y` down.
- **Produced by** `projectDeviceVector` (`ArScreen.kt:1224`):
  `screenX = halfWidth·(1 + ndcX)`, `screenY = halfHeight·(1 − ndcY)`. Note the
  **Y flip** (`1 − ndcY`): NDC up is +, screen down is +.
- **Extent:** `overlaySize` — the AR `Box` in `ArScreen`, portrait-locked in
  practice (roll handling assumes display `ROTATION_0`; see
  `deviceRollDegrees` docstring, `RotationFrame.kt:127`).
- **Not the same as the image pixel frame** (§1.5) because of `FILL_CENTER`
  crop/scale. Reconciling them is a CAM-1 deliverable (§3). CAM-1e **defines the
  pure geometry required** for this image↔display reconciliation
  (`CropScaleTransform`, §9). It is **not wired into the production projection or
  renderer** — this frame is unchanged until a later slice consumes it.

---

## 2. Transform chain

Intended chain, end to end:

```
RA/Dec (J2000)                     §1.1
  └─(A) + LST + latitude        →  Alt/Az                 §1.2
        └─(B) spherical→cartesian → ENU world vector      §1.3
              └─(C) world→device (Rᵀ) → device/camera vector §1.4
                    └─(D) pinhole project → normalized camera coords (NDC)
                          └─(E) NDC → image pixels / screen pixels §1.5/§1.6
```

Per step: existing code · missing code · sign/handedness risks · tests needed.

### Step A — RA/Dec + time/location → Alt/Az

- **Existing:** `raDecToAltAz()` (Meeus relations, Saemundsson refraction) and
  `lstAt()`/`gmstDeg()` (IAU-1982 GMST, ≈0.1° accurate near J2000). AR builds
  LST via `lstAt(instant, lon)` in `ArViewModel.buildState`.
- **Missing:** nothing structural. For matching, decide a single refraction
  policy (see risks).
- **Sign/handedness risks:**
  - Azimuth is clockwise-from-North; do not feed it to a math-CCW routine.
  - **Refraction inconsistency:** `raDecToAltAz` defaults `applyRefraction =
    true`, but the AR projector calls it with `applyRefraction = false`
    (`ArScreen.kt:967`), while the reticle's inverse `altAzToRaDec` has no
    refraction term at all. CAM-1 must pick one convention (recommend
    refraction **off** for geometric matching; it is <0.6° except very low and
    biases altitude only) and document it.
  - Hour-angle sign: `τ = LST − RA`; a swapped sign mirrors east/west.
- **Tests needed:** already covered by
  `core/astro/.../transform/EquatorialHorizontalTransformTest.kt` and
  `.../time/SiderealTimeTest.kt`. Add: a **round-trip** assertion
  (`altAzToRaDec(raDecToAltAz(x))` ≈ x with refraction off) and a couple of
  **absolute golden** cases (known star Alt/Az at a fixed instant/site).

### Step B — Alt/Az → ENU world vector

- **Existing:** `horizontalToVector()` (`ArScreen.kt:1249`) and its inverse
  `vectorToHorizontal()` (`ArScreen.kt:1260`).
- **Missing:** these are `private` inside `:mobile`. CAM-1 should promote a
  shared, tested version into `:core:astro-core` (e.g. alongside the transform
  package) so both rendering and matching use one implementation.
- **Sign/handedness risks:**
  - `az = atan2(x, y)` with `x=East, y=North`. Swapping the atan2 args, or
    using `atan2(y, x)`, rotates azimuth by 90° and/or mirrors it.
  - `z = sin(alt)`; a sign error flips the sky top-to-bottom.
- **Tests needed:** cardinal-direction table (N→(0,1,0), E→(1,0,0),
  zenith→(0,0,1)); `vectorToHorizontal(horizontalToVector(h)) ≈ h`.

### Step C — world → device/camera vector

- **Existing:** `RotationFrame` (attitude), `remapForDisplay` (display
  rotation), `correctedForTrueNorth` (declination), and `transpose()` →
  `worldToDevice = transpose(rotationMatrix)` in `calculateOverlay`
  (`ArScreen.kt:952`).
- **Missing:** camera-to-IMU extrinsic (assumed identity). A hook for a small
  calibration rotation (the CAM-1 output, §5) to be applied here.
- **Sign/handedness risks:**
  - **Magnetic vs true North:** forgetting `correctedForTrueNorth` biases every
    azimuth by the local declination (can be >10°).
  - **Display remap:** the `AXIS_*` mapping per `Surface.ROTATION_*`
    (`DisplayRemap.kt`) must match the resolution of the analyzed image; if the
    image analyzer applies its own rotation, remap and image rotation can
    double-count or cancel. Verify against the image, not just the preview.
  - **Camera = −Z:** `forwardWorld` negates the matrix column; dropping the
    negation points the reticle at the sky behind the phone.
  - Row-major vs column-major: `rotationMatrix` is row-major device→world; its
    transpose is world→device. Mislabeling inverts the rotation.
- **Tests needed:** `remapForDisplay` invariance (already partly covered by
  `ProjectionOrientationTest`); a declination-offset test asserting a known
  world azimuth lands on the expected device bearing; a "camera points at the
  vector under the reticle" round-trip.

### Step D — device vector → normalized camera coords (NDC)

- **Existing:** `projectDeviceVector()` (`ArScreen.kt:1210`) and
  `projectionParams()` (`ArScreen.kt:1201`): pinhole with
  `ndcX = (x/−z)/tanHFov`, `ndcY = (y/−z)/tanVFov`; rejects `z ≥ −0.01`
  (behind camera) and `distance > MAX_SCREEN_DISTANCE`.
- **Missing (the core CAM-1 gap):**
  - Real focal length / FOV instead of `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` (§3).
  - Principal-point offset (currently assumed dead-centre).
  - Lens distortion (currently none).
- **Sign/handedness risks:**
  - Y flip lives here (`1 − ndcY`); getting it wrong mirrors vertically.
  - `tanHFov = tanVFov · aspect` assumes square pixels and that FOV scales with
    the *viewport* aspect — wrong once the camera image aspect ≠ viewport
    aspect (the `FILL_CENTER` problem).
  - Using the wrong FOV scales all separations, so matches drift outward from
    centre (a pure scale error is the classic FOV bug).
- **Tests needed:** on-axis star projects to exactly `(cx, cy)`; a star at
  half-FOV projects to the frame edge; FOV-scaling test (double FOV → half the
  pixel offset); mirror test (a star to the observer's left must land on the
  correct screen side for the back camera).

### Step E — NDC → image pixels / screen pixels

- **Existing:** linear map to Compose pixels over `overlaySize`
  (`ArScreen.kt:1224`).
- **Existing (CAM-1e, pure only):** the **image↔display mapping**.
  `PreviewView.FILL_CENTER` center-crops the camera frame to fill the view;
  matching against detected points must run in the *image* frame (§1.5) and then
  map into the display frame (or vice-versa) using the crop/scale. CAM-1e adds
  the pure `CropScaleTransform` for exactly this (§9), tested for both
  directions — but it is **not wired** into this projection path or any renderer.
- **Sign/handedness risks:**
  - Crop direction: FILL_CENTER can crop either width or height depending on
    aspect; picking the wrong axis shifts everything.
  - DPI/px vs image-px: overlay is in dp-derived px; image is in sensor px.
  - Front/back camera mirroring: only the **back** camera is used
    (`DEFAULT_BACK_CAMERA`), which is not mirrored — but any future front-camera
    path would need an explicit horizontal flip.
- **Tests needed:** a crop/scale unit test for each aspect regime (image wider
  than view, taller than view, equal); a golden mapping a known image pixel to
  a known screen offset and back.

## 3. Camera intrinsics

### 3.1 Current state

| Intrinsic | Today | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Focal length / FOV | Hardcoded `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0`; H-FOV = `atan(tanVFov·aspect)` | `ArScreen.kt:1276`, `projectionParams` |
| Sensor size | Not modeled | — |
| Principal point | Assumed image centre `(w/2, h/2)` | `projectDeviceVector` |
| Image resolution | Uses **viewport** (`overlaySize`), not the camera image | `calculateOverlay` |
| Display crop/scale | Ignored (`FILL_CENTER` crop unaccounted) | `CameraPreview` |
| Lens distortion | None | — |

### 3.2 How to obtain / approximate (CAM-1)

Read Camera2 `CameraCharacteristics` for the bound CameraX camera (via
`Camera2CameraInfo.from(cameraInfo)`), then:

- **FOV / focal length (required):** compute from
  `LENS_INFO_AVAILABLE_FOCAL_LENGTHS` (mm) and
  `SENSOR_INFO_PHYSICAL_SIZE` (mm):
  `FOVₓ = 2·atan(sensorWidth / (2·f))`, likewise vertical. This replaces the
  hardcoded 56°. Fall back to 56° V-FOV only if characteristics are missing.
- **Sensor size (required as input to FOV):** `SENSOR_INFO_PHYSICAL_SIZE`,
  cross-checked against `SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE` and the crop from the
  chosen `ImageAnalysis` resolution.
- **Image resolution (required):** the `ImageAnalysis` output size
  (`ImageProxy.width/height` after analyzer rotation) — this, not the viewport,
  is the frame to match in.
- **Principal point (approximate for MVP):** image centre. Prefer
  `LENS_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION` `[cx, cy]` when
  `LENS_INFO_AVAILABLE_APERTURES`/calibration data are present and
  `LENS_POSE_REFERENCE` indicates a real calibration; otherwise centre.
- **Display crop/scale (required):** derive from the ratio of the
  `ImageAnalysis` aspect to the `PreviewView` aspect under `FILL_CENTER`.
  Provide a pure function mapping image-px ↔ display-px.
- **Lens distortion (defer):** ignore radial distortion for CAM-1; most phone
  main cameras are <1–2 px near centre. Record `LENS_DISTORTION` if present but
  do not apply it in the MVP.

### 3.3 Required for CAM-1 minimum viable matching vs deferred

**Required (MVP):**

- Real per-device FOV (from focal + sensor), replacing the 56° constant.
- The analyzed image resolution and its aspect.
- Principal point = image centre.
- Image↔display crop/scale mapping (so predictions and detections share a
  frame).
- A documented refraction convention (§2, Step A).

**Deferred (post-MVP):**

- Lens distortion correction.
- Non-central principal point from `LENS_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION`.
- Camera-to-IMU extrinsic rotation (assume identity; the CAM-1 calibration
  correction absorbs small residuals).
- Per-frame autofocus focal-length changes (main cameras vary little; sample
  focal length once per session unless it reports otherwise).

### 3.4 CAM-1b implementation status (this PR)

CAM-1b implements the §3.2 intrinsics contract as real, tested code but does **not** wire it into
rendering. `ArScreen.calculateOverlay()` / `projectionParams(viewport)` still call the legacy
fixed-FOV path (`VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0`, `core/astro-core/.../projection/Projection.kt`)
unchanged. The code below has **zero production call sites** as of this PR — this is intentional
(§8 note below).

**Pure model** — package `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera` in `:core:astro-core`:

- `CameraIntrinsics` (`CameraIntrinsics.kt`): `horizontalFovDeg`, `verticalFovDeg`,
  `focalLengthMm?`, `sensorWidthMm?`, `sensorHeightMm?`, `principalPointXPx?`,
  `principalPointYPx?`, `source: CameraIntrinsicsSource`. Validates eagerly in `init {}`: both
  FOVs must be finite and satisfy `0 < fov < 180`. The optional physical metadata —
  `focalLengthMm`, `sensorWidthMm`, `sensorHeightMm` — must be finite and **strictly positive**
  when present (a physical dimension can never be zero). The optional principal-point image
  coordinates — `principalPointXPx`, `principalPointYPx` — are not physical dimensions; they must
  be finite and **non-negative** when present, since an image-coordinate axis legitimately starts
  at pixel `0`. Invalid values throw `IllegalArgumentException` — never silently clamped, per the
  CAM-1b contract.
- `CameraIntrinsicsSource`: `CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS`, `CAMERA_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION` (reserved,
  unused as of CAM-1b — see principal point below), `LEGACY_FALLBACK`.
- `fovDegFromFocalLength(sensorDimensionMm, focalLengthMm)` (`CameraFov.kt`), plus
  `horizontalFovDeg(...)`/`verticalFovDeg(...)` wrappers: pure `fov = 2 * atan(sensorDimensionMm /
  (2 * focalLengthMm))` in degrees. Rejects non-finite/non-positive inputs; for any valid input the
  result is always strictly within `0 < fov < 180` (`atan` is bounded within `(-π/2, π/2)`).
- `legacyFallbackCameraIntrinsics(imageWidthPx?, imageHeightPx?)`
  (`LegacyFallbackCameraIntrinsics.kt`): builds the explicit fallback value. Vertical FOV reuses the
  *same* `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG` constant `projectionParams` uses (both are `internal` in
  `:core:astro-core`, so this is a single source of truth, not a re-guessed literal). Horizontal FOV
  mirrors `projectionParams`'s own aspect-derived formula (`tanHFov = tanVFov * aspect`) when the
  analyzed image size is known, else defaults to the vertical FOV — an explicit, documented
  square-aspect policy, not a guess about physical lens geometry.

**Android provider** — package `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera` in `:mobile`:

- `CameraIntrinsicsProvider.resolve(cameraInfo, imageWidthPx, imageHeightPx):
  CameraIntrinsicsResolution` (`CameraIntrinsicsProvider.kt`) is the production entry point;
  `Camera2CameraIntrinsicsProvider` is the CameraX/Camera2-backed implementation.
- `CameraIntrinsicsResolution(intrinsics, fallbackReason: String?)` wraps the result — this
  intentionally deviates from returning a bare `CameraIntrinsics` so the fallback diagnostic
  reason survives to the caller (see fallback semantics below).
- Metadata is read via `Camera2CameraInfo.from(cameraInfo)` (`Camera2CharacteristicsSource.kt`),
  using exactly:
  - `CameraCharacteristics.LENS_INFO_AVAILABLE_FOCAL_LENGTHS` (`FloatArray`, millimetres).
  - `CameraCharacteristics.SENSOR_INFO_PHYSICAL_SIZE` (`SizeF`, millimetres) → width/height.
  - `LENS_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION`, `SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE`, `SENSOR_INFO_PIXEL_ARRAY_SIZE`,
    and `LENS_DISTORTION` are **not read** in CAM-1b — see principal point below.
  (`Camera2CameraInfo.getCameraCharacteristic()` is gated by `ExperimentalCamera2Interop`, an
  AndroidX legacy Java-based `@RequiresOptIn`-style marker (`androidx.annotation.RequiresOptIn`),
  not Kotlin's native opt-in mechanism. It must be suppressed with `androidx.annotation.OptIn`, not
  `kotlin.OptIn` — the two annotations share identical call syntax
  (`@OptIn(ExperimentalCamera2Interop::class)`), so importing the wrong one is an easy, silent
  mistake: `kotlin.OptIn` compiles cleanly and even passes plain JVM unit tests, but Android Lint's
  `UnsafeOptInUsageError` check — which enforces this marker, not the Kotlin compiler — only
  recognizes `androidx.annotation.OptIn` and fails `:mobile:lintInternalDebug` without it.)
- No CameraX dependency bump was needed: `androidx.camera:camera-camera2:1.3.4` (already a
  `:mobile` dependency) provides `Camera2CameraInfo`/`ExperimentalCamera2Interop`; CAM-1b adds no
  new CameraX artifacts.
- Resolution logic (`resolveCameraIntrinsics`, `CameraIntrinsicsResolver.kt`) is isolated behind the
  `CameraCharacteristicsSource` adapter — a `CameraCharacteristicsSnapshot` plain data holder,
  decoupled from `CameraCharacteristics.Key` mechanics — so it is unit-tested with fake metadata:
  no real camera, no Robolectric.
- **Focal-length selection rule**: `selectFocalLengthMm` returns a `FocalLengthSelection`
  (`Resolved(focalLengthMm)` / `NoneValid` / `Ambiguous`) after filtering
  `LENS_INFO_AVAILABLE_FOCAL_LENGTHS` down to finite, positive candidates. Only the **exactly one
  valid candidate** case resolves — `resolveCameraIntrinsics` then labels the result
  `CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS`. Zero valid candidates is `NoneValid`. **Two or more** valid candidates
  is `Ambiguous` and also falls back: static `CameraCharacteristics` has no field saying which of
  several reported focal lengths the currently bound capture stream is actually using (that needs a
  live `CaptureResult`, out of CAM-1b's scope — no capture pipeline exists yet), so picking one
  value out of several — even a deterministic pick like the minimum — would risk mislabeling a
  guess as calibrated metadata. (Most phone main cameras report exactly one focal length; multiple
  values only occur on variable-optical-zoom lenses.)
- **Fallback semantics**: each of the following returns
  `CameraIntrinsicsResolution(legacyFallbackCameraIntrinsics(imageWidthPx, imageHeightPx),
  fallbackReason)`, i.e. `intrinsics.source == LEGACY_FALLBACK` plus a short, non-device-specific
  diagnostic string (no raw exception message or stack trace is logged or stored):
  - `CameraCharacteristicsSource.snapshot()` throws → `"camera_characteristics_unavailable"`.
  - no valid (finite, positive) focal length in the array — missing array, empty array, or all
    entries invalid → `"no_valid_focal_length"`.
  - more than one valid focal length in the array (ambiguous — see selection rule above) →
    `"ambiguous_focal_length"`.
  - sensor width/height missing, non-finite, or `<= 0` → `"missing_or_invalid_sensor_size"`.
  - the computed `CameraIntrinsics` itself fails validation (defensive; not expected given the
    upstream guards) → `"computed_intrinsics_invalid"`.

  A successful resolution has `fallbackReason == null` and
  `intrinsics.source == CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS`.
- **Principal point**: always `null` in CAM-1b. `LENS_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION` is deliberately not
  parsed — its coordinate mapping (which array indices, which reference frame, interaction with the
  active-array crop) is not yet confirmed against a real `ImageAnalysis` pipeline, and CAM-1b adds
  no such pipeline (see §7 non-goals, unchanged). CAM-1c/1d will initially use the analyzed image
  centre and revisit `LENS_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION` once that image↔intrinsics mapping exists and can
  be tested.

**Renderer status (unchanged by this PR):** `ArScreen.calculateOverlay()` and
`projectionParams(viewport)` still call the legacy fixed `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` /
aspect-derived-horizontal-FOV path exclusively. `CameraIntrinsicsProvider` has zero production call
sites — no `ArViewModel`/`ArScreen`/`CameraPreview` code constructs or reads a
`Camera2CameraIntrinsicsProvider` yet. No `ImageAnalysis` use case, frame pipeline, timestamp
pairing, crop/scale mapping, star matcher, or `VisibleRealStarProvider` wiring was added.

### 4.1 Current state

- **Attitude timestamp exists:** `RotationFrame.timestampNanos = event.timestamp`
  (`RotationFrame.kt:73`), from `SensorEvent.timestamp` (nanoseconds; on most
  devices `SystemClock.elapsedRealtimeNanos`, but the base clock is **not
  guaranteed** across sensors/vendors).
- **Frame timestamp does not exist:** the CameraX `Preview`-only path exposes no
  frame timestamp. `ImageProxy.imageInfo.timestamp` is unavailable because
  there is no `ImageAnalysis`.

### 4.2 Intended pairing (CAM-1 with an image pipeline)

1. Add an `ImageAnalysis` use case; each `ImageProxy` carries
   `imageInfo.timestamp` (ns) and `imageInfo.rotationDegrees`.
2. Buffer recent `RotationFrame`s in a small ring (e.g. last ~10, ~200 ms at
   `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME`).
3. For a captured frame, select the attitude sample **nearest in time** to the
   frame timestamp (linear-interpolate the rotation via slerp if the gap is
   large). Reject the pairing if the nearest attitude is older than a threshold
   (e.g. >50 ms) or the device is rotating fast (attitude rate over a gate).
4. Because sensor and camera clocks may not share a base, prefer treating both
   as `elapsedRealtimeNanos` and, if a systematic offset is detected, expose a
   single calibratable delta rather than assuming zero.

### 4.3 Safe CAM-1 fallback (no reliable pairing)

Star positions change slowly (~15°/hour ≈ 0.004°/s). So the MVP can avoid tight
sync entirely:

- **Require the device to be near-still** for a match attempt (gate on attitude
  angular rate below a small threshold, e.g. <1°/s), and use the **latest
  available** `RotationFrame` at the moment the frame is analyzed.
- Report the attitude-to-frame age in the output metadata so callers can reject
  stale matches.
- This trades a small, bounded pointing error for zero clock-alignment work and
  is sufficient to validate matching before investing in true sync.

### 4.4 CAM-1c implementation status (this PR)

CAM-1c adds the first real frame pipeline: an `ImageAnalysis` use case bound alongside `Preview`,
and a metadata-only extraction path. It does **not** implement §4.2's timestamp pairing, §4.3's
near-still matching gate, image↔display crop/scale mapping, or any matcher — those remain for
CAM-1d and later. The renderer (`ArScreen.calculateOverlay()` / `projectionParams(viewport)`)
still calls the legacy fixed `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` path exclusively, unchanged by this PR, and
`CameraIntrinsicsProvider`/`Camera2CameraIntrinsicsProvider` (CAM-1b) still has zero production call
sites — CAM-1c does not wire them together. That combination is left for CAM-1d.

**Pure model** — `CameraFrameMetadata` (`core/astro-core/.../projection/camera/CameraFrameMetadata.kt`),
package `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera` in `:core:astro-core`, alongside CAM-1b's
`CameraIntrinsics`:

- Fields: `timestampNanos: Long`, `bufferWidthPx: Int`, `bufferHeightPx: Int`, `rotationDegrees:
  Int`, plus optional `cropRectLeftPx/TopPx/RightPx/BottomPx: Int?` — plain integers, never an
  Android `Rect`.
- Validated eagerly in `init {}`: `timestampNanos >= 0`; `bufferWidthPx > 0` and `bufferHeightPx >
  0`; `rotationDegrees` in `{0, 90, 180, 270}`; the four crop-rect fields are either all present or
  all absent, and when present must satisfy `left >= 0`, `top >= 0`, `left < right`, `top < bottom`,
  `right <= bufferWidthPx`, `bottom <= bufferHeightPx`. Invalid values throw
  `IllegalArgumentException`, never silently clamped — same convention as `CameraIntrinsics`.
- `bufferWidthPx`/`bufferHeightPx` are recorded exactly as `ImageProxy` reports them: **not** swapped
  based on `rotationDegrees`, and **not** assumed to equal any `PreviewView`/viewport size (§1.5/§3.3
  still list the image↔display crop/scale mapping as not implemented).

**Extraction seam** — package `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera` in `:mobile`
(`CameraFrameMetadataSource.kt`):

- `CloseableFrameMetadataSource` is a thin interface exposing exactly `timestampNanos`, `widthPx`,
  `heightPx`, `rotationDegrees`, the four optional crop fields, and `close()` — decoupled from
  `ImageProxy` mechanics so extraction logic is unit-tested with a plain fake
  (`FakeFrameMetadataSource` in tests), no real camera, no `ImageProxy` mock.
- `toCameraFrameMetadata()` is the pure mapping from those raw fields to a validated
  `CameraFrameMetadata`.
- `ImageProxyFrameMetadataSource` is the production adapter wrapping a real `ImageProxy`. It reads
  **exactly**: `imageProxy.imageInfo.timestamp`, `imageProxy.width`, `imageProxy.height`,
  `imageProxy.imageInfo.rotationDegrees`, and `imageProxy.cropRect.{left,top,right,bottom}`. It never
  reads `imageProxy.planes`, `imageProxy.image`, or any pixel row/stride — those APIs are not called
  anywhere in this slice's production or test code. `close()` delegates to `ImageProxy.close()`.

**Sink/publisher contract** — `CameraFrameMetadataSink.kt`, same package:

- `CameraFrameMetadataSink` is a one-method interface (`fun onFrame(metadata: CameraFrameMetadata)`).
- `CameraFrameMetadataProvider` is the production implementation: a `StateFlow<CameraFrameMetadata?>`
  (`latest`) updated by simple assignment (`_latest.value = metadata`) on every `onFrame` call. This
  gives latest-value-only semantics with no queue — the previous frame is discarded, never
  accumulated — and thread-safe publication for free (`StateFlow.value` assignment is atomic).
  `frameCount`/`failedFrameCount` are `AtomicLong` counters exposed via `debugState()` for the
  minimal debug readout (latest metadata + counts).
- `CameraPreview` owns one `CameraFrameMetadataProvider` per composition (`remember { ... }`), used
  today only for the throttled debug log (below). It has no other consumer yet; CAM-1d will decide
  how to expose it (e.g. through a small camera-session state) without this PR needing to guess at
  that shape.

**Analyzer** — `CameraFrameAnalyzer.kt`, same package: a CameraX `ImageAnalysis.Analyzer`. Its
`analyze(ImageProxy)` wraps the `ImageProxy` in `ImageProxyFrameMetadataSource` and delegates to the
internal, independently testable `analyzeSource(CloseableFrameMetadataSource)`:

```kotlin
internal fun analyzeSource(source: CloseableFrameMetadataSource) {
    try {
        metadataSink.onFrame(source.toCameraFrameMetadata())
    } catch (e: CancellationException) {
        throw e
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        MobileLog.cameraFrameAnalysisFailed(e.javaClass.simpleName)
        onFrameFailure()
    } finally {
        source.close()
    }
}
```

`source.close()` runs in `finally`, so it executes exactly once per call regardless of outcome:
extraction success, extraction failure (invalid metadata throws `IllegalArgumentException`), or the
sink itself throwing. `CancellationException` is rethrown rather than swallowed (matching the CAM-1b
convention in `resolveCameraIntrinsics`); every other exception is caught so one bad frame cannot
crash the analyzer thread or the camera pipeline. The frame is never retained past this call — no
field stores the `ImageProxy`/source beyond the try block.

**Binding** — `mobile/src/main/java/dev/pointtosky/mobile/ar/CameraPreview.kt`:

- `ImageAnalysis.Builder().setBackpressureStrategy(ImageAnalysis.STRATEGY_KEEP_ONLY_LATEST).build()` —
  no target-resolution selector is configured; the analyzer observes whatever `ImageProxy.width` /
  `height` CameraX actually delivers (§5 "Resolution policy": do not hardcode a target resolution
  unless binding requires it, which it did not here).
- The analyzer runs on a dedicated `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` — never the main thread —
  created inside the `DisposableEffect` that owns the camera binding.
- `Preview` and `ImageAnalysis` are bound together in one call first:
  `cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle(lifecycleOwner, CameraSelector.DEFAULT_BACK_CAMERA, preview,
  imageAnalysis)`. No `unbindAll()` is called before binding (a prior revision did; that call was
  removed together with the disposal fix below — see "Lifecycle ownership and the bind/dispose race").
- If that combined bind throws `IllegalArgumentException` — the device/config rejects the
  `Preview` + `ImageAnalysis` combination (e.g. a legacy-level camera, or no back camera on a
  camera-less device/emulator) — `ImageAnalysis` is abandoned and a **Preview-only** bind is
  retried: `cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle(lifecycleOwner, CameraSelector.DEFAULT_BACK_CAMERA,
  preview)`. This preserves the AR camera view on a device that still supports `Preview` alone even
  though it rejects the optional metadata use case. See "Preview-only fallback" below.
- The existing `catch (_: IllegalStateException)` on the *combined* bind (lifecycle stopped before
  binding) is preserved unchanged and does **not** retry Preview-only — the lifecycle owner itself
  may already be gone, so there is nothing to bind into. Both the `IllegalStateException` and
  `IllegalArgumentException` branches clear the just-created `ImageAnalysis`'s analyzer (nothing was
  bound, so there is nothing to unbind) and log a bind-failure category via `MobileLog`.
- `PreviewView.ScaleType.FILL_CENTER` and all existing `Preview` lifecycle behavior are unchanged.

### Lifecycle ownership and the bind/dispose race

**This composable, not the bound `Activity` lifecycle, owns whichever use case(s) end up bound —
combined `Preview` + `ImageAnalysis`, or Preview alone after a fallback — and the analysis
executor.** Navigating away from the AR screen does not necessarily stop the `Activity` lifecycle
CameraX is bound to, so relying on that lifecycle (or on a future `unbindAll()` call the *next* time
`CameraPreview` enters composition) to release the camera would leave the old session's use case(s)
bound, its executor already shut down out from under them, and any late analyzer task submission
rejected. `CameraPreview` therefore performs its own explicit teardown on disposal, coordinated by
`dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera.CameraSessionLifecycle` — a small, CameraX-free state machine kept
in a package alongside the other camera helpers precisely so it is JVM-testable
(`CameraSessionLifecycleTest.kt`) without a real camera, `ImageAnalysis`, or `ProcessCameraProvider`.
Ownership of the actual `ProcessCameraProvider`/`Preview`/`ImageAnalysis` instances stays local to
one `DisposableEffect` invocation, captured by closure rather than stored in a separate holder type.

**The bind/dispose race is closed by one lock-serialized state machine, not by independently-atomic
fields.** An earlier revision guarded `disposed` with an `AtomicBoolean` and the registered cleanup
closure with `@Volatile` separately. That left a check-then-act gap in `confirmBound`: `onDispose`
could complete `markDisposed()` *and* `cleanupAndShutdown()` — including shutting down the executor —
in the window between `confirmBound` reading `disposed` and assigning `cleanupUseCases = cleanup`.
That interleaving left a newly bound CameraX use case registered for a cleanup that would now never
run, with the executor already gone. Making `disposed` and the cleanup closure independently atomic
cannot close this gap — only serializing the *transition* (decide disposed-or-not, decide who owns
cleanup, decide cleaned-up-or-not) through a single lock can. `CameraSessionLifecycle` holds
`disposed: Boolean`, `useCasesCleanedUp: Boolean`, and `cleanupUseCases: (() -> Unit)?` as one state
machine guarded by one `private val lock = Any()`; every public method acquires `lock` only for its
bookkeeping decision and releases it *before* invoking any caller-supplied closure, so a slow
`unbind()`/`shutdownNow()` call never blocks the other side's state transition and CameraX calls
never run while `lock` is held. `cleanupUseCases` holds whichever cleanup closure the successful bind
registered — the combined-mode closure (clear analyzer, unbind both use cases) or the Preview-only
fallback closure (unbind `Preview` alone) — `CameraSessionLifecycle` itself does not need to know
which; it only guarantees that closure runs exactly once, from exactly one caller.

**Executor shutdown is a *separate* idempotency axis from the use-case cleanup above, tracked by its
own `executorShutdown: Boolean` field under the same `lock`.** This exists specifically for the
Preview-only fallback (see below): when the combined bind is rejected with
`IllegalArgumentException`, `ImageAnalysis` — and its dedicated executor — is abandoned right there,
*before* any Preview-only fallback bind is even attempted, because there is no use case bound yet at
that point for `confirmBound`'s cleanup closure to unbind. `session.shutdownExecutorOnce {
analysisExecutor.shutdownNow() }` lets that failure-handling code shut the executor down immediately;
`cleanupAndShutdown` (below) calls the same `shutdownExecutorOnce` as its own final step, so an early
call from the failure branch and a later call from `onDispose` still shut the executor down exactly
once between them, regardless of call order — this is what closes CAM-1c's follow-up "do not let both
the failure branch and `onDispose` call `shutdownNow` twice" requirement.

**Disposal order**, run from `onDispose`:

1. `session.markDisposed()` — synchronized transition marking the session disposed, so an in-flight
   bind coroutine cannot complete a *lasting* bind (see the race below).
2. `job.cancel()` — cancels the binding coroutine's `Job`. This is best-effort, not the actual
   guard: coroutine cancellation only takes effect at a suspension point, and nothing between
   `getCameraProvider()` resolving and either `bindToLifecycle()` call returning suspends, so a
   cancelled job alone cannot stop an already-in-flight bind. Step 1's explicit flag is what
   actually prevents it.
3. `session.cleanupAndShutdown { analysisExecutor.shutdownNow() }` — under `lock`, claims whatever
   cleanup a successful bind registered (setting `useCasesCleanedUp = true` and reading+clearing
   `cleanupUseCases` in the same synchronized block as the idempotency check) and releases the lock;
   only then, outside the lock, does it invoke that cleanup — combined-mode
   (`imageAnalysis.clearAnalyzer()` then `cameraProvider.unbind(preview, imageAnalysis)`) or
   Preview-only-fallback-mode (`cameraProvider.unbind(preview)`), **never** `unbindAll()`, so a
   sibling camera owner elsewhere in the app would not be affected — and, in a `finally` block,
   shuts the executor down via `shutdownExecutorOnce`. Because `useCasesCleanedUp` is committed to
   `true` inside the lock *before* the cleanup closure runs, calling `cleanupAndShutdown` more than
   once — or when no bind ever completed — never double-unbinds, and `shutdownExecutorOnce`'s own
   independent guard means it never double-shuts-down either, even if the use-case cleanup closure
   itself throws (see "Cleanup exception semantics" below).

**The bind/dispose race** has three windows, all closed by the same lock:

- *Early*: disposal happens while `getCameraProvider()` is still suspended, or in the gap right
  after it resolves but before the combined `bindToLifecycle()` is called. The coroutine checks
  `session.isDisposed` immediately after the provider resolves and returns without creating or
  binding any use case if disposal already happened.
- *Between combined failure and the fallback attempt*: disposal happens after the combined bind is
  rejected (`IllegalArgumentException`) but before the Preview-only retry. The coroutine re-checks
  `session.isDisposed` right before that second `bindToLifecycle(lifecycleOwner, selector, preview)`
  call and skips it entirely if disposal already happened — the same explicit-guard reasoning as the
  early window: neither this check nor the `bindToLifecycle` call it guards suspends, so a cancelled
  job cannot substitute for it.
- *Late*: disposal happens *during* a synchronous `bindToLifecycle()` call itself — combined or
  Preview-only — i.e. the bind completes successfully but only after `onDispose` has already run.
  Immediately after either successful bind, the coroutine calls `session.confirmBound { <unbind the
  use case(s) that specific bind bound> }`. Under `lock`, `confirmBound` checks
  `disposed || useCasesCleanedUp`: if either is already true — disposal has claimed cleanup, or has
  already finished it — it releases the lock and runs the passed cleanup closure itself,
  immediately, unbinding the just-bound use case(s) right there, and returns `false`, so neither
  `MobileLog.cameraAnalysisBound()` nor `MobileLog.cameraPreviewBoundWithoutAnalysis()` is logged for
  a session that never actually stayed alive. If neither is true, it registers `cleanupUseCases =
  cleanup` inside the same synchronized block (so `onDispose`'s later `cleanupAndShutdown` is
  guaranteed to see it) and returns `true`. Because both `confirmBound` and `cleanupAndShutdown` make
  their decision inside the same lock, exactly one side ever invokes a given cleanup closure for
  every possible thread interleaving — verified directly by a two-thread, barrier-coordinated,
  2000-iteration race test in `CameraSessionLifecycleTest` that asserts the cleanup and shutdown
  callbacks each fire exactly once regardless of which side wins.
- *Duplicate registration*: a second `confirmBound` call on a still-live session (before disposal)
  throws `IllegalStateException` rather than silently overwriting the first registered cleanup —
  `confirmBound`'s `check(cleanupUseCases == null)` runs inside the same synchronized block as the
  registration itself, so this too is race-free. `CameraPreview` never calls `confirmBound` more
  than once per bind coroutine — the combined-success and Preview-only-fallback-success branches are
  mutually exclusive and each `return@launch`es afterward — so this is a defensive contract
  violation guard, not a path exercised in normal operation.

**Cleanup exception semantics**: if the use-case cleanup closure `cleanupAndShutdown` invokes (or the
one `confirmBound` invokes immediately on the late-dispose path) throws, that exception propagates to
the caller — it is not swallowed. `cleanupAndShutdown` still guarantees `shutdownExecutorOnce` runs,
via a `finally` block around the cleanup invocation, and because `useCasesCleanedUp` was already
committed to `true` inside the lock *before* the cleanup ran, a subsequent `cleanupAndShutdown` call
is still a no-op for the use-case side even after the first one threw; `executorShutdown`'s own
independent guard means the executor itself is never shut down twice regardless.

**Failed binds**: if the combined `bindToLifecycle` throws and the Preview-only fallback is either
skipped (disposed) or also throws, `session.confirmBound` is never called at all on that coroutine
run — no cleanup is registered, so there is no stale session reference for a later `onDispose` to act
on. `onDispose`'s `cleanupAndShutdown` still runs (there is simply nothing registered to unbind) and
still shuts the executor down via `shutdownExecutorOnce` — a no-op if the failure-handling code
already did so.

**Executor shutdown uses `shutdownNow()`, not `shutdown()`**, for prompt teardown on navigation away
*or* on a rejected combined bind. By the time `analysisExecutor.shutdownNow()` runs — whether from
`session.shutdownExecutorOnce` called early out of the combined-bind `IllegalArgumentException`
branch, or later from `onDispose`'s `cleanupAndShutdown` — the analyzer has already been cleared, so
CameraX will not submit further analyzer tasks through it. `shutdownNow()` discards at most one
already-queued (not yet started) metadata-extraction task rather than running it — `ImageAnalysis`
with `STRATEGY_KEEP_ONLY_LATEST` on a single-thread executor never has more than one task in flight or
queued at a time. That discarded task only ever reads timestamp/size/rotation and closes the frame —
never pixel data — so discarding it is safe; CameraX's own use-case teardown (triggered by whichever
`unbind` call applies) releases the underlying buffer regardless. A task that is already *running*
when `shutdownNow()` is called completes normally: `CameraFrameAnalyzer.analyzeSource` performs no
blocking/interruptible operation, so the interrupt request does not truncate its `finally`-closed
extraction.

All CameraX provider bind/unbind calls (both `bindToLifecycle` attempts, `confirmBound`'s cleanup
closure, and `onDispose`'s `cleanupAndShutdown`) run on `Dispatchers.Main` or Compose's disposal
callback — i.e. the main thread — matching CameraX's requirement that provider bind/unbind
operations stay off background threads.

### Preview-only fallback when ImageAnalysis binding is unsupported

Some devices/configurations reject the combined `Preview` + `ImageAnalysis` use-case combination
(`bindToLifecycle` throws `IllegalArgumentException`) even though they support `Preview` alone —
e.g. a `LEGACY`-level Camera2 hardware level with a restrictive supported-combination table. Before
this fallback existed, that rejection left *both* use cases unbound, so the AR screen went
permanently black on such a device even though nothing about the AR overlay itself required
`ImageAnalysis` (§0: it feeds only the metadata-only pipeline's throttled debug log — no production
renderer call site reads it).

**Flow**, entirely inside the single bind coroutine, on `Dispatchers.Main`:

1. Attempt the combined bind. `IllegalStateException` (lifecycle already stopping) is handled exactly
   as before — clear the analyzer, `shutdownExecutorOnce`, log `camera_analysis_bind_failed(reason =
   "illegal_state")`, and return; **no fallback is attempted**, because the lifecycle owner itself may
   already be gone, so there is nothing left to bind Preview into either.
2. `IllegalArgumentException` on the combined bind: clear the analyzer, `shutdownExecutorOnce` (see
   above), log `camera_analysis_bind_failed(reason = "illegal_argument_fallback_preview_only")`, then
   re-check `session.isDisposed` (the "between combined failure and the fallback attempt" race window
   above) before retrying with `cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle(lifecycleOwner,
   CameraSelector.DEFAULT_BACK_CAMERA, preview)` — Preview alone, the same `Preview` instance from
   the failed combined attempt, never a new one.
3. If that Preview-only bind succeeds, `session.confirmBound { cameraProvider.unbind(preview) }`
   registers a cleanup that unbinds **Preview only** — it never references or unbinds
   `imageAnalysis`, which was never bound in this path. `MobileLog.cameraPreviewBoundWithoutAnalysis()`
   is logged only if `confirmBound` returns `true` (not a late-dispose race loss) — deliberately a
   different event from `MobileLog.cameraAnalysisBound()`, so the two bind outcomes (frame metadata
   available vs. preview-only) are distinguishable in logs/telemetry.
4. If the Preview-only bind also throws — `IllegalStateException` or `IllegalArgumentException` —
   that is logged as `camera_analysis_bind_failed(reason = "illegal_state_fallback_failed")` or
   `"illegal_argument_fallback_failed"` respectively, and the coroutine returns without calling
   `confirmBound`: no cleanup is ever registered, matching the "Failed binds" behavior above, and
   nothing is left running (the executor was already shut down in step 2).

**What never changes** regardless of which path is taken: `cameraProvider.unbind(...)` is always
called with exactly the use case(s) this composition itself bound — never `unbindAll()` — and
`onDispose`'s disposal order (mark disposed → cancel job → `cleanupAndShutdown`) is identical.
`CameraPreview` does not know or care, at the `onDispose` call site, whether combined or Preview-only
binding succeeded; `CameraSessionLifecycle`'s registered `cleanupUseCases` closure already captures
that.

**Timestamp contract:** `CameraFrameMetadata.timestampNanos` is exactly
`ImageProxy.imageInfo.timestamp` — camera-clock nanoseconds, **not** wall-clock time. It must never
be compared to `System.currentTimeMillis()`. This slice makes **no claim** that it shares a clock
base with `SensorEvent.timestamp` (§4.1); measuring and pairing the two, per §4.2, is CAM-1d's job.
No interpolation or sensor matching is implemented here.

**Logging** (`MobileLog`, `dev.pointtosky.mobile.logging`): `cameraAnalysisBound()` (one event per
successful bind), `cameraAnalysisBindFailed(reasonCategory)` (bind failure category —
`"illegal_state"` / `"illegal_argument"`), `cameraFrameMetadata(widthPx, heightPx, rotationDegrees,
frameCount)` (throttled — logged on frame 1 and every 30th frame after, via
`CameraFrameMetadataProvider`, never once per frame), and `cameraFrameAnalysisFailed(reasonCategory)`
(analyzer failure category — the thrown exception's simple class name only, never a message or stack
trace, never device-specific detail).

**What CAM-1c explicitly does not do:** wire `CameraIntrinsicsProvider` to a bound `CameraInfo`;
change `ArScreen`/`projectionParams` rendering; implement the image↔display crop/scale mapping (§2
Step E); pair frame timestamps with `RotationFrame` (§4.2); add a detector, matcher, or any CV
library; read `imageProxy.planes`/`image`; or add user-facing capture controls.

### 4.5 CAM-1d implementation status (this PR)

CAM-1d measures whether the two clocks from §4.1 appear comparable and implements a bounded
nearest-sample pairing seam. It does **not** assume the two clocks share a base going in — pairing
results, not an assumption, are what feed the diagnostic compatibility status below — and it does
**not** wire the resulting pairs into rendering or matching.

**Timestamp sources (unchanged from CAM-1c/existing rotation pipeline):**

- Sensor: `RotationFrame.timestampNanos = event.timestamp` (`RotationFrame.kt`) — raw
  `SensorEvent.timestamp`, nanoseconds, propagated with no adjustment. CAM-1d does not add a second
  sensor stream or substitute `System.nanoTime()`: the same `event.timestamp` value used to build
  `RotationFrame` is copied, in the same `onSensorChanged` callback, into a `TimedRotationSample`.
- Camera: `CameraFrameMetadata.timestampNanos` — exactly `ImageProxy.imageInfo.timestamp` (CAM-1c,
  unchanged).
- Rotation matrix: `TimedRotationSample.rotationMatrix` is the same **display-remapped**
  `RotationFrame.rotationMatrix` array already consumed by `calculateOverlay`/`deviceRollDegrees` —
  not a second, raw-sensor-coordinate copy. `RotationSampleHistory` defensively copies it on
  ingestion, so later reuse of the shared array reference at the `RotationFrame.kt` call site cannot
  corrupt history state.

**Pure models** — `:core:astro-core`, package `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera` (no
Android/CameraX types anywhere in this list):

- `TimedRotationSample(timestampNanos, rotationMatrix)` — `timestampNanos >= 0`, `rotationMatrix`
  exactly 9 elements, both validated eagerly (`TimedRotationSample.kt`).
- `FrameRotationPair(frame, rotation, deltaNanos)` and the sealed `FrameRotationPairingResult`
  (`Paired`, `NoSamples`, `OutsideTolerance`, `ClockMismatchSuspected`) (`FrameRotationPairing.kt`).
- `pairFrameToNearestRotation(frame, samples, maxAllowedDeltaNanos, clockMismatchThresholdNanos)` —
  pure, deterministic, retains nothing past the call. **Selection:** minimum
  `abs(frame.timestampNanos - sample.timestampNanos)`, overflow-safe (saturating subtract/abs helpers
  in the same file — timestamps are validated non-negative, so overflow cannot occur today, but the
  arithmetic does not rely on that holding forever). **Tie-break:** when two samples are equidistant
  in time from the frame, the **earlier** sample (smaller `timestampNanos`) is preferred,
  unconditionally — no interpolation is performed either way.
  **Classification:** `delta <= MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS` → `Paired`; `delta >
  CLOCK_MISMATCH_THRESHOLD_NANOS` → `ClockMismatchSuspected`; otherwise → `OutsideTolerance`. A frame
  outside `MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS` is never paired, regardless of which of the latter two results it
  gets.
- `RotationSampleHistory(capacity)` (`RotationSampleHistory.kt`) — a single-lock-guarded, timestamp-
  sorted buffer capped at `capacity` (never an unbounded list/queue). Out-of-order `add()` calls are
  still sorted correctly; when `capacity` is exceeded, the **smallest**-timestamp sample(s) are
  evicted first. Duplicate timestamps are preserved (never deduplicated); an exact-timestamp
  `nearest()` query against multiple duplicates resolves to the most-recently-`add`-ed one (delta is
  `0` for all of them, so "earlier" does not disambiguate — arrival order does). Both `add()` and
  `nearest()`/`snapshot()` defensively copy the `FloatArray` matrix, so neither side can corrupt the
  other's state by mutating an array it still holds a reference to.
- `TimestampSyncDiagnostics`/`TimestampSyncDebugState`/`TimestampCompatibility`
  (`TimestampSyncDiagnostics.kt`) — see the compatibility-state policy below.

**Thresholds** — one place, `TimestampSyncConfig` (`TimestampSyncConfig.kt`, same package):

| Constant | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS` | 50 ms | `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME` nominally delivers ~every 20 ms; 50 ms covers a couple of sensor ticks of jitter plus scheduling latency on either stream while staying well below star-field angular drift (§4.3: ~0.004°/s). |
| `CLOCK_MISMATCH_THRESHOLD_NANOS` | 5 s | Two orders of magnitude above `MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS`, so an ordinary tolerance rejection is never misclassified as a clock-base mismatch; a delta this large cannot plausibly arise from scheduling jitter between two streams sharing a real time base. |
| `ROTATION_HISTORY_CAPACITY` | 120 | ~2 s of history at ~50 Hz nominal `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME` — comfortably wider than `MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS` without growing unbounded. |
| `MIN_OBSERVATIONS_FOR_COMPATIBLE` | 5 | Consecutive in-tolerance pairs required before claiming `COMPATIBLE_OBSERVED` — enough to rule out a one-off coincidence without over-claiming after a single lucky pair. |
| `MIN_CONSECUTIVE_MISMATCHES_FOR_SUSPECTED` | 3 | Consecutive clock-mismatch-scale deltas required before claiming `MISMATCH_SUSPECTED` — one isolated bad sample must not flip the whole session's verdict. |

These are conservative starting points chosen from first principles (sensor delivery rate, star-field
drift rate, order-of-magnitude separation), **not** values tuned against one physical device — see
the device-gate note below.

**Compatibility-state policy** (`TimestampSyncDiagnostics`, conservative by design — this is a
diagnostic inference, never proof):

- Starts `UNKNOWN`.
- A run of `MIN_OBSERVATIONS_FOR_COMPATIBLE` **consecutive** `Paired` results moves the state to
  `COMPATIBLE_OBSERVED` — unless the state is already `MISMATCH_SUSPECTED`, which is treated as the
  stronger claim and is not silently overwritten by a handful of subsequent good pairs.
  `OutsideTolerance`/`NoSamples` are neutral: they neither extend nor reset the "consecutive
  compatible" streak, since neither carries direct evidence about the clock base (only that a sample
  was too far away, or that none existed yet).
  A `ClockMismatchSuspected` result resets the "consecutive compatible" streak to zero.
- A run of `MIN_CONSECUTIVE_MISMATCHES_FOR_SUSPECTED` **consecutive** `ClockMismatchSuspected` results
  moves the state to `MISMATCH_SUSPECTED`. A `Paired` result resets the "consecutive mismatch" streak
  to zero — one isolated bad sample does not flip the session's verdict.
- Running `minAbsDeltaNanos`/`maxAbsDeltaNanos`/`meanAbsDeltaNanos` are updated from every result that
  carries a delta (`Paired`, `OutsideTolerance`, `ClockMismatchSuspected`), not only successful pairs,
  so they reflect the full observed delta distribution, not just the paired subset. `NoSamples`
  carries no delta and leaves them unchanged. All statistics are running counters/min/max/sum — bounded
  and cheap regardless of session length; no percentile/rolling-window tracking is implemented (marked
  optional in scope, intentionally omitted for this slice).

**Integration** — `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera.CameraTimestampSynchronizer`
(`CameraTimestampSynchronizer.kt`): owns one `RotationSampleHistory` and one `TimestampSyncDiagnostics`,
publishes only the latest `FrameRotationPairingResult` via a `StateFlow` (never a queue of every
pair). It is callback-driven and owns no coroutine/`Job` of its own — `onRotationSample`/
`onCameraFrame` are called directly and synchronously from wherever a new sample already arrives, so
there is no separate collector coroutine to manage or leak:

- `rememberRotationFrame` (`RotationFrame.kt`) gained an optional `onRotationSample:
  (TimedRotationSample) -> Unit = {}` parameter, invoked once per sensor sample from inside the
  existing `onSensorChanged` callback, right after building that call's `RotationFrame` — the
  smallest seam that copies recent production rotation frames into the history without a second
  sensor stream. Defaults to a no-op, so no other caller of `rememberRotationFrame` is affected.
- `CameraPreview` (`CameraPreview.kt`) gained an optional `onFrameMetadata: (CameraFrameMetadata) ->
  Unit = {}` parameter. Internally, the `ImageAnalysis.Analyzer`'s sink now forwards each extracted
  frame to **both** the existing, `remember`ed `CameraFrameMetadataProvider` (unchanged throttled
  debug log) and `onFrameMetadata` — never instead of the provider. This does not broaden
  `CameraPreview`'s ownership: its bind/dispose lifecycle, `CameraSessionLifecycle` usage, and
  executor management are all unchanged; the only addition is one extra forward of a value it
  already extracts. `CancellationException` propagation is inherited unchanged from
  `CameraFrameAnalyzer.analyzeSource` (CAM-1c, already tested in `CameraFrameAnalyzerTest`): if the
  sink — including this forward — throws `CancellationException`, `analyzeSource` rethrows it rather
  than swallowing it; any other exception is caught, logged via `cameraFrameAnalysisFailed`, and does
  not crash the analyzer thread.
- `ArScreen` owns one `CameraTimestampSynchronizer` (`remember`ed), passes
  `timestampSynchronizer::onRotationSample` to `rememberRotationFrame` and
  `timestampSynchronizer::onCameraFrame` to `CameraPreview`'s `onFrameMetadata`, and calls
  `timestampSynchronizer.dispose()` from its own top-level `DisposableEffect(Unit)`'s `onDispose`.
  **Ownership is terminal, not reusable:** `dispose()` is a one-way transition — after it,
  `onRotationSample`/`onCameraFrame` are permanently no-ops (not even a `NoSamples` result is
  published) — because a new `ArScreen` composition receives a brand-new `remember`ed
  `CameraTimestampSynchronizer` instance, so no session ever needs to "clear and keep going" on the
  same instance. This is what actually prevents a stale rotation sample from a previous AR session
  pairing with the first camera frame of a new one (§8 "leave/re-enter AR") — not a same-instance
  reset.
  **Disposal is serialized with session activity through one internal lock**, not independent
  atomics: `onRotationSample`, `onCameraFrame`, and `dispose` each hold that lock for their entire
  check-disposed → read/mutate-state transition, so a callback already in flight on another thread
  when `dispose()` runs either completes and publishes before `dispose()` acquires the lock (and
  `dispose()` then clears its effect), or observes `disposed == true` once it acquires the lock after
  `dispose()` (and does nothing) — there is no interleaving where a late callback publishes a result
  or updates diagnostics after disposal has completed. `MobileLog` calls are made only after the lock
  is released, from an immutable snapshot decided while holding it, so logging never happens while
  the lock is held. `debugState()`/`latestResult` are exposed for future diagnostics UI but are not
  consumed by rendering or matching in this PR.

**Logging** (`MobileLog`, throttled/categorical, never per-frame): `timestampSyncSessionStarted()`
(once, on the first camera frame observed), `timestampSyncFirstPair(deltaMillis)` (once, on the first
successful pair), `timestampSyncSummary(deltaMillis, pairedCount, rejectedCount, compatibility)`
(every 30th processed camera frame), `timestampSyncClockMismatchSuspected(deltaMillis)` (once, on the
transition into `MISMATCH_SUSPECTED`), `timestampSyncUnavailableNoSamples()` (once, on the first frame
with no rotation samples to pair against). None of these log a matrix, a raw device identifier, an
exception message, or a full timestamp stream — only millisecond-rounded deltas and bounded counters/
categories.

**Physical-device gate:** device measurement (camera buffer dimensions, frame/sensor timestamp
progression, first 20–50 nearest deltas, min/mean/max absolute delta, paired-vs-rejected counts, and
resulting compatibility status, across stationary/slow-pan/fast-pan/leave-re-enter/orientation
scenarios) was **not** performed as part of this PR. Whether camera and rotation-sensor timestamps
are actually comparable on any given device — and whether `MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS`/
`CLOCK_MISMATCH_THRESHOLD_NANOS` above are well-calibrated for it — remains an open device gate; the
thresholds in this PR are conservative first-principles defaults, not device-validated values, and
must not be read as "confirmed compatible on Android" from this PR alone.

**What CAM-1d explicitly does not do:** interpolate or SLERP rotation matrices; implement the
image↔display `CropScale` mapping (§2 Step E, still open); wire `CameraIntrinsicsProvider` into
rendering (`ArScreen`/`projectionParams` still use the legacy fixed `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0`
exclusively, unchanged); feed `FrameRotationPairingResult`/`FrameRotationPair` into rendering, the
overlay, or any matcher; add a detector or CV library; add persistent timestamp storage; or compare
either timestamp to `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

## 5. Matching inputs / outputs (CAM-1 data model)

These are **proposed** shapes to live in a new pure module (suggest
`:core:catalog` visibility/render neighborhood or a new `:core:camera-match`
Kotlin module) so they are unit-testable without Android. Field names are
illustrative; types are the contract.

### 5.1 Input model

```kotlin
/** Everything CAM-1 needs to attempt a match for one frame. Pure data. */
data class CameraMatchInput(
    // Visible star candidates (from VF-1 / VF-2a): equatorial J2000 + mag.
    val candidates: List<VisibleRealStar>,      // dev.pointtosky.core.catalog.visibility.render.VisibleRealStar

    // Camera intrinsics for the analyzed frame (see §3).
    val intrinsics: CameraIntrinsics,

    // Device attitude paired with the frame (see §4).
    val attitude: DeviceAttitude,

    // Frame metadata (resolution, timestamp, rotation, crop mapping).
    val frame: FrameMetadata,

    // Optional detected bright points in IMAGE pixels (§1.5). Empty = predict-only.
    val detectedPoints: List<ImagePoint> = emptyList(),

    // Observing context for RA/Dec → Alt/Az.
    val lstDeg: Double,
    val latDeg: Double,
    val refraction: Boolean = false,             // fixed convention, see §2 Step A
)

data class CameraIntrinsics(
    val hFovDeg: Double,
    val vFovDeg: Double,
    val principalPoint: ImagePoint,              // ≈ image centre for MVP
    val imageWidthPx: Int,
    val imageHeightPx: Int,
    val distortion: Distortion? = null,          // null = pinhole (MVP)
)

data class DeviceAttitude(
    val worldToDevice: FloatArray,               // 3×3, world(ENU,true-north)→device
    val trueNorthCorrected: Boolean,             // must be true for matching
    val timestampNanos: Long,
)

data class FrameMetadata(
    val timestampNanos: Long,
    val rotationDegrees: Int,                     // ImageProxy.imageInfo.rotationDegrees
    val attitudeAgeNanos: Long,                   // frame.ts − attitude.ts (§4.3)
    val imageToDisplay: CropScale,                // §2 Step E mapping
)

data class ImagePoint(val u: Double, val v: Double)
```

`VisibleRealStar` is reused verbatim from VF-2a
(`raDeg, decDeg, mag, bv?, hip?, name?`) so CAM-1 consumes VF-1's output
directly via `VisibleRealStarProvider.snapshot(...)`.

### 5.2 Output model

```kotlin
sealed interface CameraMatchResult {

    /** A usable calibration correction was found. */
    data class Success(
        // Small corrective rotation to apply after worldToDevice (§2 Step C),
        // expressed as yaw/pitch/roll deltas in degrees (or a quaternion).
        val correction: AttitudeCorrection,
        val confidence: Double,                  // 0..1
        val matches: List<StarMatch>,            // candidate ↔ detected/predicted
        val residualRmsDeg: Double,              // angular RMS after correction
    ) : CameraMatchResult

    /** No reliable match; explains why. */
    data class Failure(val reason: FailureReason) : CameraMatchResult
}

data class AttitudeCorrection(
    val yawDeg: Double,
    val pitchDeg: Double,
    val rollDeg: Double,
)

data class StarMatch(
    val candidateIndex: Int,                     // index into CameraMatchInput.candidates
    val hip: Int?,                               // catalog identity when known
    val predicted: ImagePoint,                   // where the star was expected
    val detected: ImagePoint?,                   // matched detection, null if predict-only
    val residualDeg: Double,
)

enum class FailureReason {
    TOO_FEW_CANDIDATES,        // not enough visible stars in frame
    TOO_FEW_DETECTIONS,        // detector found nothing usable
    DEVICE_MOVING,             // attitude rate gate (§4.3)
    STALE_ATTITUDE,            // attitudeAgeNanos over threshold
    AMBIGUOUS,                 // multiple equally-good solutions
    NO_CONVERGENCE,            // solver did not converge
    LOW_ALTITUDE,             // frame below horizon / no sky
}
```

**Notes:**

- If `detectedPoints` is empty, CAM-1 runs in **predict-only** mode: it returns
  the projected positions of the candidates (no correction), which is enough to
  build/verify the pipeline before any computer vision exists.
- The correction is intentionally a small rotation, not full intrinsics
  re-estimation — it absorbs residual IMU/declination/extrinsic bias.

---

## 6. Test strategy

All of the following can be pure JVM unit tests (no device), consistent with
the existing `mobile/.../ar/*Test.kt` and `core/astro*/.../*Test.kt` suites.

1. **RA/Dec → Alt/Az sanity** — extend
   `EquatorialHorizontalTransformTest`: add a round-trip
   (`altAzToRaDec∘raDecToAltAz ≈ id`, refraction off) and 2–3 absolute goldens
   (named star Alt/Az at a fixed UTC + site, tolerance ~0.05°). Pin the
   refraction convention with an explicit on/off case.
2. **Projection centre** — a star exactly on the optical axis (device `−Z`)
   projects to the principal point `(cx, cy)`; a star at `+half-HFOV` lands on
   the horizontal frame edge. Assert on `projectDeviceVector` with real
   intrinsics.
3. **Display rotation cases** — reuse/extend `ProjectionOrientationTest`
   ("polyline shape stable across rotations") and `DeviceRollDegreesTest`
   (upright→0°, +90° CW→−90°, +90° CCW→+90°, near-zenith→fallback) for all four
   `Surface.ROTATION_*` values, including image `rotationDegrees` interplay.
4. **Mirrored / handedness mistakes** — a star to the observer's physical left
   must project to the correct screen side for the **back** camera; assert the
   sign of the ENU→device→NDC chain (a deliberate "flip X" mutation must fail
   the test). Include a magnetic-vs-true-north offset case that fails if
   `correctedForTrueNorth` is skipped.
5. **FOV scaling** — with a fixed device vector, doubling FOV halves the pixel
   offset from centre; a wrong-FOV constant is caught as a pure scale error.
   Add an image-aspect ≠ viewport-aspect case that fails without the crop/scale
   mapping.
6. **No-match / failure cases** — each `FailureReason` has a test:
   empty candidates → `TOO_FEW_CANDIDATES`; empty detections in match mode →
   `TOO_FEW_DETECTIONS`; high attitude rate → `DEVICE_MOVING`; stale attitude
   age → `STALE_ATTITUDE`; all candidates below horizon → `LOW_ALTITUDE`.
7. **Golden matching scenario (integration)** — synthesize a frame from a known
   attitude + intrinsics + a handful of catalog stars, generate "detections" by
   projecting them (optionally with a small injected attitude error), and assert
   CAM-1 recovers the injected `AttitudeCorrection` within tolerance and returns
   the correct `StarMatch` HIP ids. Mirror the style of
   `core/astro/.../integration/AimPipelineScenarioTest.kt`.

---

## 7. Non-goals (explicitly excluded from CAM-1)

- **Full computer-vision star detection** — CAM-1 must run predict-only and,
  at most, consume simple externally-supplied bright points. No blob detector,
  no ML, unless a later slice needs it.
- **Renderer switch** — keep the existing Compose `Canvas` overlay
  (`ArScreen`); do not move to OpenGL/`GLSurfaceView`/ARCore rendering.
- **Live camera-matching UI** — no new user-facing calibration screen is
  required for the core slice; matching can be exercised from tests/debug first.
- **Moon / twilight modeling for matching** — the physically-driven
  `limitingMagnitudeAt` already exists for visibility; CAM-1 does not add sky
  brightness or twilight models beyond consuming VF-1's visible set.
- **Proper-motion correction** — PTSKCAT0 is J2000 with no PM; CAM-1 uses
  catalog RA/Dec as-is. (Naked-eye stars move ≪ the matching tolerance over the
  relevant epoch span, so this is safe.)
- **Camera-to-IMU extrinsic calibration** — assume identity; the small
  `AttitudeCorrection` output absorbs residual bias.

---

## 8. Recommended CAM-1 implementation slice

A thin, testable vertical slice that de-risks the hard parts (intrinsics +
frame alignment) without committing to computer vision:

1. **Extract the projection math into `:core:astro-core` (or a new
   `:core:camera-match`).** Promote `horizontalToVector`, `vectorToHorizontal`,
   and `projectDeviceVector` out of `:mobile` `private` scope into shared,
   fully-tested pure functions. No behavior change; unblocks tests §6.2–6.5.
2. **Real intrinsics.** Add a `CameraIntrinsics` provider that reads Camera2
   `CameraCharacteristics` (focal length + physical sensor size → FOV) for the
   bound CameraX camera, replacing `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0`. Fall back to 56°
   when characteristics are absent. (§3.3 required set only.)

   **CAM-1b status:** the provider, resolution logic, and fallback described
   above are implemented and tested (§3.4), but the "replacing
   `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0`" wiring into `ArScreen`/`projectionParams` is
   deliberately **not** done in CAM-1b — the renderer still calls the legacy
   path unchanged. That wiring is left for a later CAM slice once the intrinsics
   contract has had a chance to be reviewed independently of any rendering
   change.
3. **Frame pipeline + crop/scale.** Add an `ImageAnalysis` use case to obtain
   frame resolution, `rotationDegrees`, and `imageInfo.timestamp`. Implement the
   pure image↔display `CropScale` mapping for `FILL_CENTER` (§2 Step E) with
   unit tests §6.5.

   **CAM-1c status:** the `ImageAnalysis` use case, `CameraFrameMetadata` model, extraction seam,
   and latest-value sink described above (§4.4) are implemented and tested — frame resolution,
   `rotationDegrees`, and `imageInfo.timestamp` all reach Kotlin now. The image↔display `CropScale`
   mapping is **not** implemented in CAM-1c; `ImageProxy.cropRect` is captured as plain integers on
   `CameraFrameMetadata` but nothing maps it to display pixels yet. Timestamp pairing with
   `RotationFrame` (§4.2) is CAM-1d; the pure `FILL_CENTER` image↔display `CropScale` mapping itself
   is **CAM-1e** (§9) — geometry only, still not wired into rendering.
4. **Predict-only matcher.** Implement `CameraMatchInput → CameraMatchResult`
   (§5) in predict-only mode: consume VF-2a `VisibleRealStar` candidates, apply
   Steps A–E with real intrinsics, and emit predicted `StarMatch` positions plus
   the failure reasons. Use the §4.3 "device near-still, latest attitude"
   fallback. No detector yet.
5. **Golden scenario test.** Add the §6.7 integration test that injects a known
   attitude error and asserts recovery once the (still-stubbed) correction
   solver is enabled — initially asserting predict-only positions, then wired to
   a minimal least-squares correction when detections are supplied.

This slice delivers per-device-correct projection, a real frame/intrinsics
pipeline, and the CAM-1 data contract, while leaving detection, extrinsics,
distortion, and any UI for later slices.

---

## 9. CAM-1e image↔display `FILL_CENTER` CropScale mapping (this PR)

CAM-1e defines and tests **geometry only**: a pure, Android-independent mapping
that describes how a camera image / crop rectangle is rotated, uniformly scaled,
center-cropped, and positioned inside the displayed viewport under
`PreviewView.ScaleType.FILL_CENTER`, in **both directions**. It reads no pixels,
does no interpolation, consumes no timestamp pairs (§4) or intrinsics (§3), adds
no detector/matcher, and is **not** wired into the renderer — the AR overlay
still uses the legacy fixed 56° projection (§Step E, `projectionParams`)
unchanged.

**Pure models** — `:core:astro-core`, package
`dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera` (no Android `PointF`/`Rect`/
`RectF`/`Size`/`Matrix`, no Compose type):

- `PixelPoint(x, y)`, `PixelSize(width, height)`, `PixelRect(left, top, right,
  bottom)` (`PixelGeometry.kt`) — all values validated eagerly: finite, sizes
  strictly positive, rectangles strictly ordered (`left < right`, `top <
  bottom`). No silent clamping.
- `CropScaleTransform` with `imageToDisplay`, `displayToImage`,
  `imageRectToDisplay`, `isImagePointVisible`, `isDisplayPointInsideVisibleImage`,
  `visibleImageRect`, `visibleDisplayRect` (`CropScaleTransform.kt`).
- Factories: `CropScaleTransform.fillCenter(sourceCrop, sourceBufferSize,
  rotationDegrees, viewportSize)` (pure sizes/rects) and
  `createFillCenterCropScaleTransform(frame: CameraFrameMetadata,
  viewportWidthPx, viewportHeightPx)` (from CAM-1c metadata).

### 9.0 Construction contract (invalid states unrepresentable)

`CropScaleTransform`'s primary constructor is **private** and the class is
annotated `@ConsistentCopyVisibility` (so the generated `copy()` is private too).
The **only** way to obtain an instance is `CropScaleTransform.fillCenter(...)`
(or `createFillCenterCropScaleTransform(...)`, which delegates to it):

- Callers supply **only source geometry, rotation, and viewport geometry**. There
  is no parameter through which a caller can pass `uniformScale`,
  `rotatedSourceSize`, or the display offsets.
- The factory **derives** `rotatedSourceSize`, `uniformScale`, `displayOffsetX`,
  and `displayOffsetY` internally, from a single private helper
  (`deriveFillCenter`) that is the one place the scale/offset formulas live.
- `init` re-derives those four values from the source/rotation/viewport and
  `require`s the stored values match (within a small epsilon for the derived
  floating-point comparison). Together with the private constructor/`copy()`,
  this makes an instance that is internally finite but does **not** represent
  `PreviewView.ScaleType.FILL_CENTER` **not representable** by any path.
- `init` also enforces **strict** source-crop domain bounds (`left ≥ 0`,
  `top ≥ 0`, `right ≤ bufferWidth`, `bottom ≤ bufferHeight`) with **no epsilon
  slack on these caller inputs** — a crop even slightly outside the buffer is
  rejected, never clamped. Epsilon is used only for the derived-value comparison.

### 9.1 Coordinate spaces

All spaces share the same pixel convention: **origin top-left, `+x` right, `+y`
down**, unit = pixels. The mapping never introduces a Y-flip (unlike §Step E's
NDC→screen `1 − ndcY`, which is a separate concern in the legacy projector).

1. **Buffer space** — raw `ImageProxy.width × ImageProxy.height`
   (`CameraFrameMetadata.bufferWidthPx/bufferHeightPx`). The **public image side
   of the API is buffer-relative**: `imageToDisplay(p)` takes a buffer-space
   point and `displayToImage(q)` returns one.
2. **Crop space (crop-local)** — the active `ImageProxy.cropRect`
   (`CameraFrameMetadata.cropRect*`), translated so the crop's top-left is the
   origin: `cropLocal = (bufferX − left, bufferY − top)`, ranging
   `[0, cropWidth] × [0, cropHeight]`. **Convention chosen: crop-local,
   internal.** Callers always pass/receive buffer-relative points; the transform
   converts to crop-local internally and back.
3. **Rotated image space** — crop-local coordinates after the clockwise
   `rotationDegrees` rotation; dimensions swap for 90°/270°
   (`rotatedSourceSize`).
4. **Display / viewport space** — `PreviewView`/Compose overlay pixels over
   `viewportSize`. This is the same frame as §1.6, but note CAM-1e maps into
   raw viewport pixels and does **not** reconcile against the legacy projector's
   `overlaySize` usage — that reconciliation is a later slice.

### 9.2 Continuous edge-coordinate convention

Coordinates are **continuous image-edge coordinates** in `[0, W] × [0, H]`, not
pixel-center indices in `[0, W−1] × [0, H−1]`. The top-left buffer corner is
`(0, 0)` and the bottom-right corner is `(bufferWidth, bufferHeight)`. This is
chosen deliberately: the inverse transform and viewport scaling stay free of the
`−1` magic constants that pixel-center coordinates would force in. The two
conventions are never mixed.

### 9.3 Clockwise rotation formulas

`rotationDegrees` is interpreted as `ImageProxy.imageInfo.rotationDegrees`: the
**clockwise** rotation required to bring the buffer into display/target
orientation. Rotation is applied in **crop-local** space (after the buffer→crop
translation), around the crop-local origin. For crop-local `(x, y)` with
unrotated crop size `W × H`:

```text
  0°: x' = x           y' = y            rotated size = W × H
 90°: x' = H − y       y' = x            rotated size = H × W
180°: x' = W − x       y' = H − y        rotated size = W × H
270°: x' = y           y' = W − x        rotated size = H × W
```

Inverse (rotated `(x', y')` → crop-local `(x, y)`):

```text
  0°: x = x'           y = y'
 90°: x = y'           y = H − x'
180°: x = W − x'       y = H − y'
270°: x = W − y'       y = x'
```

These are exact inverses and compose correctly (90°∘90° = 180°, 90°×4 =
identity).

### 9.4 `FILL_CENTER` scale and offsets

For rotated source `rotatedW × rotatedH` and viewport `viewportW × viewportH`:

```text
scale   = max(viewportW / rotatedW, viewportH / rotatedH)
scaledW = rotatedW · scale
scaledH = rotatedH · scale
offsetX = (viewportW − scaledW) / 2
offsetY = (viewportH − scaledH) / 2
```

`max` guarantees the scaled source always fully **covers** the viewport (that is
what `FILL_CENTER` means). Exactly one of `offsetX`/`offsetY` is negative (the
center-cropped axis) unless the aspect ratios match, in which case both are `0`.
**Negative offsets are never clamped** — clamping would break both the center
crop and reversibility. `FIT_CENTER`/`FILL_START`/`FILL_END`/arbitrary
`ScaleType` are out of scope.

### 9.5 Forward and inverse mapping order

Forward `imageToDisplay` (buffer → display):

1. translate buffer → crop-local: `(x − left, y − top)`;
2. rotate crop-local clockwise by `rotationDegrees` (§9.3);
3. multiply by `scale`;
4. add `(offsetX, offsetY)`.

Inverse `displayToImage` (display → buffer) undoes the above in reverse:

1. subtract `(offsetX, offsetY)`;
2. divide by `scale`;
3. un-rotate (inverse of §9.3);
4. translate crop-local → buffer: `(x + left, y + top)`.

Invariant, tested over corners/edge-midpoints/center/interior points for all
four rotations and several aspect ratios (tolerance `1e-6`):

```text
displayToImage(imageToDisplay(p)) ≈ p
imageToDisplay(displayToImage(q)) ≈ q
```

Outputs are **never rounded to integers**.

### 9.6 Crop-rect behavior and non-zero crop origin

- When `CameraFrameMetadata` carries a crop rect, **only that crop** is the
  source region; when absent, the full buffer `(0, 0, bufferW, bufferH)` is used.
- A crop rect equal to the full buffer is **honoured, not ignored** (it still
  defines the source region, and future non-identity crops flow through the same
  path).
- The crop origin is **not** assumed to be `(0, 0)`. A buffer point maps through
  the crop-local translation above; the inverse restores exact **buffer-relative**
  coordinates. Example (tested): buffer `2000×1500`, crop `left=100, top=200,
  right=1900, bottom=1400` → the crop origin `(100, 200)` maps to display
  `(0, 0)` and back.

### 9.7 Visibility and center-crop semantics

- The viewport is **always fully covered** by the scaled source, so
  `visibleDisplayRect` is always the full `(0, 0, viewportW, viewportH)`.
- `visibleImageRect` is the buffer-space sub-rectangle of the crop **actually
  shown** — the inverse image of the viewport (computed from the four viewport
  corners, exact for 90°-multiple rotations). It is narrower/shorter than the
  crop on the center-cropped axis, and equals the crop only when aspects match.
- `isImagePointVisible(bufferPoint)` is true only if the point lies inside the
  crop **and** its display mapping falls inside the viewport — a point inside the
  crop but removed by the center crop is **not** visible.
- A viewport corner may inverse-map to a **non-edge** source point when aspect
  ratios differ; source points may map **outside** the viewport.
- Inverse results are **never clamped** to the crop or viewport. Clamping would
  hide geometry errors and break reversibility, so an out-of-viewport display
  point legitimately yields an out-of-crop buffer point.

### 9.8 Production integration (this PR)

**None.** CAM-1e is **pure-only**. No production code constructs, publishes, or
consumes a `CropScaleTransform` in this PR; the renderer, the PTSKCAT0/PTSKCAT4
star overlay, and the legacy 56° projection are untouched. Wiring the transform
into debug/session state was deliberately deferred rather than added, because a
correct call site needs the **Compose overlay viewport size** (the AR `Box`
extent), which lives in `ArScreen`, not in `CameraPreview` (which owns only the
`PreviewView`). Introducing that plumbing would add lifecycle surface for no
behavioral gain in a geometry-only slice.

**Intended call site for the next slice:** CAM-1e itself does not build this transform in
production. **CAM-1f** (§10) is that next slice: it builds `CropScaleTransform` from the latest
`CameraFrameMetadata` plus the measured overlay viewport size, bundles it with the paired rotation
sample and resolved-or-fallback intrinsics into one immutable `CameraSessionGeometry`, publishes it
latest-value-only, and resets it on camera-session disposal — reusing the CAM-1c/1d lifecycle
rather than creating a second session owner. A future predict-only matcher (§8 step 4) is the
*next* intended call site after CAM-1f, not CAM-1e directly.

### 9.9 CameraX `Preview`/`ImageAnalysis` equivalence caveat

This is the intended **pure** `FILL_CENTER` contract using the metadata
currently available (`CameraFrameMetadata`). It is **not** claimed that
`ImageAnalysis` buffer geometry is automatically identical to `PreviewView`'s
internal `Preview` transformation on every device:

- The mapping is valid **only if** the analyzed crop/rotation geometry
  represents the same camera-stream framing that `Preview` renders.
- CameraX may apply **additional** transformation metadata depending on
  implementation/version/device (e.g. `PreviewView`/`TransformationInfo`
  transforms) that this pure model does not yet consume.
- Future integration of CameraX `TransformationInfo`/`PreviewView` transform
  data may **refine or replace** these assumptions.
- This mapping is **not** labeled ground truth. **Physical-device overlay
  validation remains required.**

### 9.10 Device validation status

**Deferred.** Because CAM-1e adds **no production wiring** (§9.8), there is
nothing on-device to validate yet. Device validation — comparing preview vs
overlay viewport dimensions; recording source crop/rotation/scale/offsets;
rotating portrait↔landscape; confirming the viewport center maps to the expected
image center and the edge-crop direction; leaving/re-entering AR to confirm no
stale transform survives session disposal — is deferred to the first slice that
consumes image coordinates on-device. Pixel-perfect `PreviewView` alignment must
not be claimed without a visible marker/grid or a future detector.

### 9.11 Worked numerical example

Source `1920×1080`, viewport `1080×1080`, `rotationDegrees = 0`, no crop
(full-buffer source):

```text
rotatedSize = 1920 × 1080
scale       = max(1080/1920, 1080/1080) = max(0.5625, 1.0) = 1.0
scaledW×H   = 1920 × 1080
offsetX     = (1080 − 1920) / 2 = −420      # negative: horizontal center crop
offsetY     = (1080 − 1080) / 2 = 0

imageToDisplay(960, 540)  = (960·1 − 420, 540·1 + 0) = (540, 540)   # viewport center
displayToImage(0, 0)      = (0 + 420, 0)             = (420, 0)     # non-edge source point
visibleImageRect          = (420, 0, 1500, 1080)                    # central 1080-wide band shown
```

A rotated example — source `4000×3000`, viewport `1080×1920`,
`rotationDegrees = 90`, no crop:

```text
rotatedSize = 3000 × 4000                              # 90° swaps W/H
scale       = max(1080/3000, 1920/4000) = max(0.36, 0.48) = 0.48
offsetX     = (1080 − 1440) / 2 = −180
offsetY     = (1920 − 1920) / 2 = 0

imageToDisplay(2000, 1500):
  crop-local (2000, 1500) → rotate 90° → (3000−1500, 2000) = (1500, 2000)
  → (1500·0.48 − 180, 2000·0.48 + 0) = (540, 960)                  # viewport center
```

### 9.12 Confirmation (scope boundaries)

CAM-1e wires **no** pixels read, **no** YUV/RGB/interpolation, **no**
timestamp-pair (§4) consumption, **no** matcher/detector, **no** renderer
changes, **no** real-intrinsics rendering (§3), **no** PTSKCAT0/PTSKCAT4 catalog
or overlay changes, **no** lens distortion, **no** additional `ScaleType`
support, and **no** front-camera mirroring. Mapped coordinates are neither
clamped nor rounded.

## 10. CAM-1f camera-session geometry bundle (this PR)

CAM-1f combines CAM-1c frame metadata, the CAM-1d rotation sample paired to that *exact* frame
timestamp, the CAM-1e `CropScaleTransform` built from that same frame and the AR overlay viewport,
and CAM-1b intrinsics (resolved or explicit fallback) into one immutable, Android-independent
`CameraSessionGeometry`. It is the input shape a future predict-only matcher (§8 step 4) is
expected to consume; this PR adds no star matching, no detection, no interpolation, and no
renderer change — nothing yet reads the bundle it publishes.

### 10.1 Pure models — `:core:astro-core`, package `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera`

- **`CameraSessionGeometry`** (`CameraSessionGeometry.kt`):

  ```kotlin
  class CameraSessionGeometry private constructor(
      val frame: CameraFrameMetadata,
      private val pairedRotationSnapshot: TimedRotationSample,
      val frameRotationDeltaNanos: Long,
      val cropScaleTransform: CropScaleTransform,
      val intrinsics: CameraIntrinsicsResolution,
      val viewportSize: PixelSize,
  ) {
      val pairedRotation: TimedRotationSample
          get() = pairedRotationSnapshot.copy(rotationMatrix = pairedRotationSnapshot.rotationMatrix.copyOf())
  }
  ```

  A **regular class, not a `data class`** — an earlier revision exposed `pairedRotation` as a plain
  constructor property, which copied the array once on ingestion but still let a caller corrupt the
  bundle by mutating the array read back out of a `pairedRotation` access. `pairedRotation` is now a
  computed property backed by a `private` snapshot, and **every read returns a fresh defensive
  copy** — true immutability, not merely "copied once on the way in": neither the array a caller
  originally handed off, nor an array read back out of any previous `pairedRotation` access, can
  ever affect the bundle or a later read. The primary constructor is still `private`, so the only
  construction path is the pure factory `createCameraSessionGeometry` (§10.4); `init` re-derives and
  `require`s the cross-field invariants anyway, so no other path can produce an inconsistent
  instance:
  - `cropScaleTransform.sourceBufferSize` equals `frame`'s buffer dimensions;
  - `cropScaleTransform.sourceCrop` equals the frame-derived crop (`sourceCropFromFrame(frame)` —
    the frame's crop rect when present, else the full buffer; the same helper
    `createFillCenterCropScaleTransform` itself uses, so this mapping lives in exactly one place);
  - `cropScaleTransform.rotationDegrees` equals `frame.rotationDegrees`;
  - `cropScaleTransform.viewportSize` equals `viewportSize`;
  - `frameRotationDeltaNanos` equals `frame.timestampNanos - pairedRotation.timestampNanos`,
    computed with the same overflow-safe helper `FrameRotationPairingResult` uses.

  Pairing-tolerance conformance is **not** one of `init`'s invariants: `FrameRotationPairingResult.Paired`
  and `FrameRotationPair` are both public data classes any caller can construct directly, not only
  `pairFrameToNearestRotation` — an earlier revision's claim that "the factory accepts only `Paired`,
  therefore the delta must already be within tolerance" assumed a `Paired` value could only
  originate from `pairFrameToNearestRotation`, which is false for a publicly constructible type.
  `createCameraSessionGeometry` (§10.4) validates the configured tolerance explicitly, against a
  caller-supplied threshold, before ever calling the canonical factory — see §10.2.

- **`CameraIntrinsicsResolution`** (`CameraIntrinsicsResolution.kt`) — the CAM-1f intrinsics
  policy, chosen from the two options CAM-1f's own task description offered:

  ```kotlin
  sealed interface CameraIntrinsicsResolution {
      val intrinsics: CameraIntrinsics
      data class Resolved(override val intrinsics: CameraIntrinsics) : CameraIntrinsicsResolution
      data class LegacyFallback(
          override val intrinsics: CameraIntrinsics,
          val reason: String,
      ) : CameraIntrinsicsResolution
  }
  ```

  **Policy: both resolved and fallback intrinsics may produce a `Ready` bundle** (the "Preferred"
  option) — a fallback bundle is diagnostically usable (every geometric field is still valid) but
  is never described as fully calibrated: `Resolved.intrinsics.source` can never be
  `LEGACY_FALLBACK` and `LegacyFallback.intrinsics.source` can never be anything else (`init`
  enforces both directions), and every `Ready` result carries an explicit `CameraGeometryQuality`
  (§10.5) derived from this type, never guessed. This mirrors CAM-1b's own
  `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera.CameraIntrinsicsResolution(intrinsics, fallbackReason: String?)`
  contract (§3.4) — CAM-1f's sealed hierarchy makes the same distinction impossible to forget, since
  there is no nullable field to skip checking. `:mobile`'s
  `SessionScopedCameraIntrinsicsResolver` (§10.7) maps the CAM-1b shape into this one exactly once
  per bound camera session.

- **`CameraSessionGeometryResult`** (`CameraSessionGeometryResult.kt`) — never a nullable
  geometry:

  ```kotlin
  sealed interface CameraSessionGeometryResult {
      data class Ready(val geometry: CameraSessionGeometry, val quality: CameraGeometryQuality) : ...
      data class MissingFrame(val viewportSize: PixelSize?) : ...
      data class InvalidViewport(val widthPx: Int, val heightPx: Int) : ...
      data class RotationUnavailable(val reason: RotationUnavailableReason, val pairingResult: FrameRotationPairingResult) : ...
      data class IntrinsicsUnavailable(val reason: IntrinsicsUnavailableReason) : ...
      data class GeometryRejected(val reason: GeometryRejectionReason) : ...
      data object Disposed : ...
  }
  ```

  `RotationUnavailable` carries `NO_SAMPLES` / `OUTSIDE_TOLERANCE` / `CLOCK_MISMATCH_SUSPECTED`.
  `GeometryRejected` carries `PAIRING_FRAME_MISMATCH` / `PAIRING_DELTA_MISMATCH` /
  `PAIRING_OUTSIDE_CONFIGURED_TOLERANCE` / `CROP_SCALE_CONSTRUCTION_FAILED` — the first three exist
  specifically because a `FrameRotationPairingResult.Paired` is publicly constructible and cannot be
  trusted as proof of anything about how it was produced; see §10.2. No reason carries raw exception
  text. `IntrinsicsUnavailable`/`MissingFrame`/`Disposed` are never returned by the pure factory
  itself (it always requires an already-resolved frame/intrinsics as input); they exist for the
  production session owner (§10.6), which publishes them while a bound session has not yet produced
  those inputs. A cheap `CameraSessionGeometryStatus` enum (`status` extension property) classifies
  any result without exposing reason detail, for logging/debug-state comparisons.

### 10.2 Frame/pairing coherence rule

A published bundle must use **one exact** `CameraFrameMetadata`, the pairing result computed for
*that same frame*, the current viewport, and the current session's intrinsics — never a frame
combined with an independently-"latest" pairing result that happened to be computed for a
different frame. **`FrameRotationPairingResult.Paired` and `FrameRotationPair` are both public data
classes** — any caller can construct one directly, not only `pairFrameToNearestRotation` — so a
`Paired` value is never trusted as self-proving anything. Coherence is enforced two ways:

1. **At the callback boundary** (Option A from CAM-1f's task description):
   `CameraTimestampSynchronizer.onCameraFrame(frame)` (CAM-1d) now *returns* the
   `FrameRotationPairingResult` it just computed and published for that exact `frame` (`null` only
   if the synchronizer is already disposed), instead of `Unit`. `ArScreen` hands the `(frame,
   pairingResult)` pair to `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.onPairedFrame` together, in one call —
   it never separately reads `CameraFrameMetadataProvider.latest` and
   `CameraTimestampSynchronizer.latestResult` and assumes they describe the same frame.
2. **At the pure factory** (not merely defense in depth — the only real gate, since the pairing
   result reaching this function did not necessarily come through step 1): `createCameraSessionGeometry`
   validates, in order:
   - **exact frame equality** — `paired.pair.frame != frame` (full `CameraFrameMetadata` structural
     equality, not just `timestampNanos`) is rejected as `GeometryRejected(PAIRING_FRAME_MISMATCH)`.
     Timestamp equality alone is **not** sufficient proof of coherence: two frames can share a
     timestamp while differing in buffer dimensions, crop rect, or rotation, and only full metadata
     equality catches that;
   - **delta arithmetic** — `paired.pair.deltaNanos` must equal the overflow-safe delta actually
     implied by `frame.timestampNanos` and `paired.pair.rotation.timestampNanos`; a mismatch is
     `GeometryRejected(PAIRING_DELTA_MISMATCH)`;
   - **configured tolerance** — the (now verified-correct) delta's absolute value must not exceed
     `maxAllowedPairDeltaNanos` (§10.4); exceeding it is
     `GeometryRejected(PAIRING_OUTSIDE_CONFIGURED_TOLERANCE)`, regardless of the `Paired` subtype
     having been used. Using the `Paired` subtype alone as tolerance proof was the exact gap this
     validation closes — a forged or mis-tagged `Paired` value cannot bypass it.

   Any caller bug at the production seam — or a forged pairing result reaching the factory by any
   other path — is caught here, categorically, never silently wrapped into a bundle.

### 10.3 Viewport authority

The AR overlay viewport (`overlaySize: IntSize`, the Compose `Box` extent in `ArScreen`) is
**authoritative** for `CropScaleTransform`'s viewport, not `PreviewView`'s own size: this is the
coordinate space a future matcher's predictions will actually be displayed in (CAM-1e §9.8 already
flagged this as the correct choice). `ArScreen` converts `overlaySize` to plain `Int` width/height
at the Compose boundary — `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.onViewportChanged(widthPx: Int, heightPx:
Int)` never sees a Compose `IntSize`. A zero-sized viewport is reported as `InvalidViewport`, never
silently mapped to a fake `1x1` transform — `PixelSize` cannot represent a non-positive size at
all, so the pure factory checks width/height *before* constructing one. `PreviewView`'s own
measured size is not read or compared against `overlaySize` in this PR; if the two ever need to be
reconciled, that is future work, not assumed equal here.

### 10.4 Pure bundle factory

```kotlin
fun createCameraSessionGeometry(
    frame: CameraFrameMetadata,
    pairingResult: FrameRotationPairingResult,
    intrinsicsResolution: CameraIntrinsicsResolution,
    viewportWidthPx: Int,
    viewportHeightPx: Int,
    maxAllowedPairDeltaNanos: Long = TimestampSyncConfig.MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS,
): CameraSessionGeometryResult
```

Deviates from the task description's illustrative `viewportSize: PixelSize` parameter deliberately:
`PixelSize` cannot represent a zero/negative size, so the *invalid* case must be checked before any
`PixelSize` is constructed — plain, possibly-invalid `Int`s let that happen. Accepts only
`FrameRotationPairingResult.Paired`; every other pairing outcome becomes a categorized
`RotationUnavailable`. `maxAllowedPairDeltaNanos` is validated explicitly (§10.2) rather than
inferred from the `Paired` subtype — it `require`s non-negative (a programmer-contract violation at
the call site throws, since that is not an expected runtime outcome) and defaults to
`TimestampSyncConfig.MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS`, but a caller whose pairing result was produced with a
non-default tolerance (e.g. a `CameraTimestampSynchronizer` constructed with a custom
`maxAllowedDeltaNanos`) must pass that same value here — see §10.6 for how the production owner
shares it. Builds the `CropScaleTransform` via the existing CAM-1e
`createFillCenterCropScaleTransform(frame, viewportWidthPx, viewportHeightPx)` — never a second,
independent CropScale construction path — catching only its `IllegalArgumentException` as
`GeometryRejected(CROP_SCALE_CONSTRUCTION_FAILED)`. Every expected-runtime rejection is a returned,
categorized result, never a thrown exception; no result carries raw exception text. Pure, no
Android dependency, no side effects, retains nothing past the call.

### 10.5 Geometry quality classification

```kotlin
enum class CameraGeometryQuality { CALIBRATED, LEGACY_INTRINSICS_FALLBACK }
```

Derived from `CameraIntrinsicsResolution` (`val CameraIntrinsicsResolution.quality`), never
guessed, and carried on every `Ready` result (`Ready.quality`) so a fallback bundle can never be
read as fully calibrated. `CameraSessionGeometryProvider`'s debug state (§10.6) preserves the same
distinction (`latestQuality: CameraGeometryQuality?`), and the throttled `MobileLog` summary logs
it as a plain string — the fallback-vs-calibrated distinction survives into logging/debug state
exactly as CAM-1f's task description required.

### 10.6 Production session owner — `:mobile`, package `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera`

**`CameraSessionGeometryProvider`** (`CameraSessionGeometryProvider.kt`) is the one session-scoped
owner. It receives:

- `onPairedFrame(frame, pairingResult)` — from `ArScreen`'s `CameraPreview.onFrameMetadata`
  callback, which calls `timestampSynchronizer.onCameraFrame(frame)` and forwards the frame
  together with its non-null return value (§10.2);
- `onViewportChanged(widthPx, heightPx)` — from a `LaunchedEffect(overlaySize)` in `ArScreen`
  (§10.3); a no-op when the value is unchanged, so recomposition noise does not force a rebuild;
- `onIntrinsicsResolved(resolution)` — from `CameraSessionIntrinsicsCoordinator` (§10.7), not
  directly from `CameraPreview.onCameraInfo`; only the *first* call per provider instance has any
  effect — intrinsics resolve at most once per bound camera session, then are reused for every
  subsequent frame.

`CameraSessionGeometryProvider`'s constructor takes `maxAllowedPairDeltaNanos: Long =
TimestampSyncConfig.MAX_PAIR_DELTA_NANOS`, threaded straight into every `createCameraSessionGeometry`
call (§10.4). This must agree with whatever tolerance the session's `CameraTimestampSynchronizer`
actually pairs against — `CameraTimestampSynchronizer.maxAllowedDeltaNanos` is a public, immutable
`val` (CAM-1f addition) for exactly this reason, and `ArScreen` reads it directly when constructing
the provider (`CameraSessionGeometryProvider(maxAllowedPairDeltaNanos =
timestampSynchronizer.maxAllowedDeltaNanos)`) rather than letting both default independently. If a
future change constructs either with a non-default tolerance, this wiring keeps them in sync
without needing to remember to update both call sites.

It publishes `state: StateFlow<CameraSessionGeometryResult>`, latest-value-only — never a queue —
plus a bounded `debugState(): CameraSessionGeometryDebugState` (observed/ready/rejected counts,
latest status/quality/pair-delta; no historical list). (CAM-1g later adds a third, combined
`observation: StateFlow<CameraSessionGeometryObservation>` publishing `state` and `debugState()`
together from the same locked recompute, specifically so a live UI observes counter changes even when
`state` alone would not re-emit a structurally-equal result — see §11.3.) A published bundle always
combines the
frame/pairing pair from the most recent `onPairedFrame` call with whatever viewport and intrinsics
are current at rebuild time (§10.2) — `onViewportChanged`/`onIntrinsicsResolved` each trigger a
rebuild against the still-latest frame/pairing pair, so a viewport rotation or the intrinsics
callback arriving after the first frame both produce a fresh bundle without waiting for the next
camera frame.

**Thread safety and disposal** follow the CAM-1d `CameraTimestampSynchronizer` convention exactly:
one internal lock serializes every update method with `dispose()` — a single state-machine
transition, not independent atomics — so a callback already in flight when `dispose()` runs either
publishes before disposal clears it, or observes `disposed == true` and no-ops; there is no
interleaving that republishes after disposal completes (verified by the same
barrier-coordinated race-test pattern CAM-1d uses, `CameraSessionGeometryProviderTest`).
`dispose()` is terminal and idempotent: every update method becomes a permanent no-op afterward,
`state` becomes `CameraSessionGeometryResult.Disposed`, and all cached inputs/counters are cleared
— so no stale previous-session bundle can survive into a new one. `MobileLog` calls are always
issued from an immutable snapshot decided while holding the lock, never while holding it. One
provider instance belongs to one AR camera session (`remember`ed in `ArScreen`, disposed from the
same top-level `DisposableEffect` that disposes `timestampSynchronizer`); a new session gets a new
instance rather than reusing a disposed one.

### 10.7 Intrinsics resolution — `:mobile`, package `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera`

**`SessionScopedCameraIntrinsicsResolver`** (`SessionScopedCameraIntrinsicsResolver.kt`) wraps
CAM-1b's `CameraIntrinsicsProvider`/`Camera2CameraIntrinsicsProvider` — reused verbatim, no second
resolver or Camera2 seam — with once-per-instance caching: the first `resolveOnce(cameraInfo,
imageWidthPx, imageHeightPx)` call performs the real Camera2 `CameraCharacteristics` lookup and
maps CAM-1b's `CameraIntrinsicsResolution(intrinsics, fallbackReason: String?)` into CAM-1f's
sealed `CameraIntrinsicsResolution` (§10.1); every later call on the same instance returns the
cached value without repeating the lookup. One instance belongs to one bound camera session
(`remember`ed alongside `CameraSessionGeometryProvider`); re-entering AR creates a new instance, so
a fresh resolution is always attempted — nothing is cached across sessions.

**`resolveOnce`'s dimensions are `Int`, not `Int?`, and `require`d strictly positive** — an earlier
revision accepted nullable, defaulted-to-`null` dimensions and dismissed calling it with `null` as
"a minor nicety, not a correctness requirement." That was wrong: the real per-device
`CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS` path genuinely does not depend on the analyzed image's dimensions (focal
length and physical sensor size are static device properties), but the **legacy fallback path does**
— `legacyFallbackCameraIntrinsics` derives its horizontal FOV from the analyzed image's aspect
ratio (§3.4), defaulting to a square 1:1 assumption when the dimensions are unknown. Because
resolution only ever happens once per session and is cached for its entire lifetime, resolving with
`null` at the moment `CameraInfo` becomes available — which is usually *before* the first
`ImageAnalysis` frame has arrived — would permanently publish a wrong fallback horizontal FOV for
every device that ever takes the fallback path with a non-square analyzed buffer (16:9, 4:3, or any
other real aspect ratio). `CameraSessionGeometry.intrinsics` is part of the published bundle, so
this is a correctness bug in what CAM-1f actually reports, not a cosmetic detail.

**`CameraSessionIntrinsicsCoordinator`** (`CameraSessionIntrinsicsCoordinator.kt`, CAM-1f addition)
is what guarantees `resolveOnce` is only ever called once both real inputs are known:

```kotlin
class CameraSessionIntrinsicsCoordinator(
    private val resolver: SessionScopedCameraIntrinsicsResolver,
    private val onResolved: (CameraIntrinsicsResolution) -> Unit,
) {
    fun onCameraInfo(cameraInfo: CameraInfo)
    fun onFrameMetadata(frame: CameraFrameMetadata)
    fun dispose()
}
```

- **Order-independent**: `onCameraInfo`/`onFrameMetadata` may arrive in either order — CameraX gives
  no guarantee which fires first — and either ordering resolves correctly, exactly once, using the
  *first* accepted `CameraInfo` and the *first* accepted frame's real `bufferWidthPx`/`bufferHeightPx`.
  A repeated call to either method, once its own input has already been accepted, is a no-op; later
  `CameraInfo`/frame values never override the first.
- **Preview-only fallback**: if the combined `Preview` + `ImageAnalysis` bind is rejected and
  `CameraPreview` falls back to Preview-only (§4.4), `onCameraInfo` may still fire, but no
  `ImageAnalysis` frame is ever produced, so `onFrameMetadata` never fires. Resolution therefore
  never happens in that case — by construction, not a special case — and CAM-1f geometry correctly
  stays unavailable (no frame means no pairing means no bundle either; §10.6's `MissingFrame`/
  `IntrinsicsUnavailable` states cover this). No `PreviewView` dimension is ever substituted for the
  missing analyzed-frame dimensions, and Preview-only camera display itself is unaffected.
- **Thread safety**: one internal lock guards the atomic "both inputs present, not yet claimed"
  transition. `resolveOnce` (real Camera2 work) runs *outside* that lock — it must never block a
  concurrent `onCameraInfo`/`onFrameMetadata`/`dispose` caller. The final `onResolved` publish,
  however, is a deliberate, reviewed exception: it runs **while holding the lock**, serialized with
  `dispose()` (see below). This is safe only because the production callback
  (`geometryProvider::onIntrinsicsResolved`) takes its own separate lock and never calls back into
  the coordinator — no lock cycle, no reverse acquisition.
- **Disposal — exact linearization rule**: terminal and idempotent, same convention as every other
  CAM-1f/CAM-1d session owner, with one precise guarantee about the boundary between it and
  publication:
  ```text
  Final onResolved publication and dispose() are serialized on the same lock.
  A publication already holding the lock (already invoking onResolved) finishes
  before a concurrent dispose() can acquire the lock and return.
  No onResolved call can begin after dispose() has returned.
  ```
  An earlier revision instead re-checked `disposed` *before* calling `onResolved`, releasing the
  lock in between the check and the call — a check-then-act window in which `dispose()` could
  complete and then a late `onResolved` call could still begin. That is now impossible: `dispose()`
  and the disposed-check-and-publish step share the same lock for the whole step, so there is no
  window between "check" and "call" for `dispose()` to run in. A resolution already inside
  `resolveOnce` when `dispose()` runs is not cancelled (it completes the Camera2 read, outside the
  lock), but if it finishes after `dispose()` has already run, its result is discarded rather than
  published. Proven by two tests in `CameraSessionIntrinsicsCoordinatorTest`: one blocks
  `resolveOnce` itself and disposes before it returns (publication never begins); the other blocks
  `onResolved` itself and disposes while it is in progress (`dispose()` provably does not return
  until `onResolved` finishes — verified via a `Future.get` with a short timeout that must throw
  `TimeoutException` while blocked, then complete promptly once released).

`ArScreen` wires `CameraPreview`'s `onCameraInfo` directly to `intrinsicsCoordinator::onCameraInfo`,
and calls `intrinsicsCoordinator.onFrameMetadata(frame)` at the top of the `onFrameMetadata`
callback — before the existing `timestampSynchronizer.onCameraFrame(frame)` call — so exact
frame/pairing coherence (§10.2) is unaffected: the coordinator only reads `frame.bufferWidthPx`/
`bufferHeightPx`, never the frame object itself, and never influences pairing. Disposal order in the
session's `DisposableEffect.onDispose` is: `timestampSynchronizer.dispose()`, then
`intrinsicsCoordinator.dispose()`, then `geometryProvider.dispose()`. The guarantee this order gives
is **not** "the geometry provider is never briefly live after an upstream session ends" — each
component's own disposal is what actually enforces its part of the contract, not the ordering
between them. The guarantees are, per component: the timestamp synchronizer accepts no new frame
pairing once *its* `dispose()` returns; the intrinsics coordinator cannot *begin* a publish once
*its* `dispose()` returns (the linearization rule above); and the geometry provider, disposed last,
is then terminally disposed itself and clears all of its own state. Disposing the two upstream
inputs before the provider simply means that by the time the provider is disposed, neither upstream
source can still be mid-callback trying to feed it — a sequencing convenience, not what makes any
individual component's contract hold.

**No recalculation is ever triggered within a session**: sensor physical size and the bound
`CameraInfo` do not change while a session is bound, and the first analyzed frame's buffer
dimensions do not change either (`ImageAnalysis` is bound once, with no target-resolution change
mid-session), so there is no scenario in this PR that needs one.

### 10.8 Logging and debug state

`CameraSessionGeometryDebugState` (`CameraSessionGeometryProvider.kt`, alongside the provider,
mirroring where CAM-1c's `CameraFrameDebugState` lives) is bounded — running counts plus the
single latest status/quality/pair-delta, no historical list. `latestStatus` always reflects the
*current* published result. `latestQuality`/`latestPairDeltaNanos` are populated only while the
current result is `Ready`, and are explicitly cleared to `null` on every transition away from
`Ready` — to `MissingFrame`, `InvalidViewport`, `RotationUnavailable`, `IntrinsicsUnavailable`,
`GeometryRejected`, or `Disposed` — so a caller reading debug state never sees a stale quality/delta
left over from a previous `Ready` bundle after the provider has actually stopped being ready. A
later `Ready` recompute (while the provider remains active) repopulates both fields from that new
bundle. `MobileLog` gained `cameraGeometry*`
events (`MobileLog.kt`): `cameraGeometrySessionStarted()` (once, first update),
`cameraGeometryFirstReady(quality)` (once, first `Ready`), `cameraGeometryStatusChanged(status)`
(logged only on an actual status transition), `cameraGeometryFallbackIntrinsicsInUse()` (once, on
the first fallback-quality `Ready`), `cameraGeometrySummary(...)` (throttled — every 30th `Ready`
recompute, never once per frame — carrying `status`, `quality`, `bufferWidthPx`/`bufferHeightPx`,
`viewportWidthPx`/`viewportHeightPx`, `rotationDegrees`, `pairDeltaMillis`, `intrinsicsSource`),
and `cameraGeometryDisposed()` (once). None of these log a rotation matrix, a raw timestamp
stream, a full `CameraIntrinsics` object, a raw exception message, a device identifier, or a pixel
buffer — matching the CAM-1c/1d logging conventions.

### 10.9 Current production wiring (this PR)

`ArScreen` owns one `CameraSessionGeometryProvider`, one `SessionScopedCameraIntrinsicsResolver`,
and one `CameraSessionIntrinsicsCoordinator` (all `remember`ed), disposes them from the same
`DisposableEffect(Unit)` that disposes `timestampSynchronizer` — in the order
`timestampSynchronizer` → `intrinsicsCoordinator` → `geometryProvider` (§10.7) — feeds
`onViewportChanged` from a `LaunchedEffect(overlaySize)`, and wires `CameraPreview`'s
`onCameraInfo` directly to `intrinsicsCoordinator::onCameraInfo` and `onFrameMetadata` to both
`intrinsicsCoordinator.onFrameMetadata` and (via `timestampSynchronizer`) `onPairedFrame`, as
described in §10.6–§10.7. **Nothing reads `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.state`** in this PR —
it is fed but not consumed. The AR renderer (`ArScreen.calculateOverlay()` / `projectionParams`)
still calls the legacy fixed `VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` path exclusively, unchanged; no real
intrinsics, crop/scale mapping, or paired rotation reaches rendering. No star matching, detection,
interpolation, or SLERP is added.

### 10.10 Device validation status

**Deferred.** CAM-1f adds a production owner that is fed real camera/rotation/viewport/intrinsics
data but consumed by nothing — there is no visible behavior change to validate on-device yet. The
manual gate for the *next* slice (whichever one first reads `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.state`)
should verify: a `Ready` bundle appears after opening AR; rotating portrait↔landscape rebuilds the
viewport and transform; panning slowly/quickly does not desync frame/pairing coherence; leaving and
re-entering AR repeatedly never surfaces a stale previous-session bundle; the Camera2 intrinsics
lookup happens exactly once per session (not once per frame); and no renderer or overlay behavior
changes throughout. As with CAM-1e (§9.10), pixel-perfect `PreviewView`/image alignment must not be
claimed from bundle readiness alone — that still requires a visible marker/grid or a future
detector.

### 10.11 Confirmation (scope boundaries)

CAM-1f reads **no** pixels, performs **no** interpolation or SLERP, adds **no** matcher or
detector, makes **no** renderer change, wires **no** real intrinsics into rendering (§3), and
changes **no** PTSKCAT0/PTSKCAT4 catalog or overlay behavior. It adds exactly one new production
session owner (`CameraSessionGeometryProvider`) and one intrinsics-resolution seam
(`SessionScopedCameraIntrinsicsResolver`) — no second camera or sensor session, no persistent
bundle history (latest-value-only throughout), no lens distortion, and no front-camera support.

---

## 11. CAM-1g debug-only diagnostic consumer and device-validation gate (this PR)

CAM-1f wired a full producer (frame → pairing → crop/scale → intrinsics → `CameraSessionGeometry`)
that nothing consumed (§10.9, §10.10: "Nothing reads `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.state` in this
PR"). CAM-1g adds the **first** consumer — a debug-only diagnostic overlay inside `ArScreen` — so the
CAM-1c–1f pipeline can finally be observed on a physical device. This slice is a **validation gate**:
it adds no matching, no detection, no projection correction, and no renderer handoff. It is also the
first slice for which a physical-device report is required, not optional.

### 11.1 Pure diagnostic model — `:mobile`, package `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera`

Deliberately **not** placed in `:core:astro-core` even though it touches only pure core types
(`CameraSessionGeometryResult`, `CropScaleTransform`, `PixelPoint`) — it exists to answer a `:mobile`
UI/validation question ("is this build's overlay showing a plausible bundle"), and its JVM tests are
exercised via `:mobile:testInternalDebugUnitTest`, not `:core:astro-core:test`.

- **`CameraGeometryDiagnosticCategory`** (`CameraGeometryDiagnostics.kt`) — a flat, stable, 13-value
  enum covering every distinct reason the pipeline can report:

  ```text
  MISSING_FRAME · INVALID_VIEWPORT · INTRINSICS_PENDING ·
  ROTATION_NO_SAMPLES · ROTATION_OUTSIDE_TOLERANCE · ROTATION_CLOCK_MISMATCH ·
  PAIRING_FRAME_MISMATCH · PAIRING_DELTA_MISMATCH · PAIRING_OUTSIDE_CONFIGURED_TOLERANCE ·
  CROP_SCALE_CONSTRUCTION_FAILED ·
  READY_CALIBRATED · READY_LEGACY_FALLBACK ·
  DISPOSED
  ```

  `CameraSessionGeometryResult.toDiagnosticCategory()` maps every sealed subtype/reason to exactly
  one of these — `Ready` splits on `CameraGeometryQuality` into the two `READY_*` values, so a
  fallback bundle is never displayed as indistinguishable from a calibrated one. Never derived from
  the sealed result's own `toString()`.

- **`CameraGeometryDiagnosticSnapshot`** (same file) — the bounded, immutable display model:

  ```kotlin
  data class CameraGeometryDiagnosticSnapshot(
      val category: CameraGeometryDiagnosticCategory,
      val quality: CameraGeometryQuality?,
      val frameTimestampNanos: Long?,
      val bufferWidthPx: Int?, val bufferHeightPx: Int?,
      val cropLeftPx: Int?, val cropTopPx: Int?, val cropRightPx: Int?, val cropBottomPx: Int?,
      val rotationDegrees: Int?,
      val viewportWidthPx: Int?, val viewportHeightPx: Int?,
      val pairDeltaNanos: Long?,
      val intrinsicsSource: CameraIntrinsicsSource?,
      val horizontalFovDeg: Double?, val verticalFovDeg: Double?,
      val uniformScale: Double?, val displayOffsetX: Double?, val displayOffsetY: Double?,
      val centerProbe: CameraGeometryCenterProbeSnapshot?,
  )
  ```

  `CameraSessionGeometryResult.toDiagnosticSnapshot()` is a **pure mapper** — no Android dependency,
  no additional state read, no pixels, no rotation matrix (`CameraSessionGeometry.pairedRotation` is
  never called from diagnostics code, since it is the one property that would otherwise force a
  defensive-copy of matrix data this slice must never expose). Geometry/FOV/scale/offset/center-probe
  fields are populated **only** for `Ready`, the only variant that actually carries a
  `CameraSessionGeometry`. Two variants are exceptions because they carry viewport data directly even
  though they are not `Ready`: `MissingFrame.viewportSize` (the last known *valid* viewport) and
  `InvalidViewport`'s raw width/height. Every other non-`Ready` variant — `RotationUnavailable`,
  `IntrinsicsUnavailable`, `GeometryRejected`, `Disposed` — reports only its `category`; the sealed
  result does not carry frame/buffer data for those variants (`FrameRotationPairingResult`'s
  non-`Paired` cases carry only bare timestamps, never a `CameraFrameMetadata`), so the snapshot
  reports "unavailable" there rather than reconstructing a value from a different source and implying
  it was captured atomically with the reported status.

- **`computeCameraGeometryCenterProbe(transform: CropScaleTransform)`** (§11.4 below) and
  **`nextDebugSessionId()`** (§11.6 below) live in the same file.

### 11.2 Debug-only visibility gate

**`CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate`** (`CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate.kt`) gates the overlay on the
project's actual build-variant matrix (`mobile/build.gradle.kts`: `flavorDimensions += "distribution"`
with `internal`/`public` flavors, plus AGP's implicit `debug`/`release` build types) rather than on a
new flag invented for this PR:

```kotlin
internal fun isDiagnosticsEnabled(debug: Boolean, flavor: String): Boolean =
    debug && flavor == "internal"

object CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate {
    val isEnabled: Boolean = isDiagnosticsEnabled(debug = BuildConfig.DEBUG, flavor = BuildConfig.FLAVOR)
}
```

`isDiagnosticsEnabled` is a plain pure function of `(debug, flavor)` — `CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGateTest`
exercises all four `(debug, flavor)` combinations against it directly, plus one assertion that the gate
*object* (`CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate.isEnabled`) agrees with `isDiagnosticsEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG,
BuildConfig.FLAVOR)` for whichever variant is currently running.

**Flavor-aware, not `internalDebug`-only.** `CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGateTest` lives in the shared
`src/test` source set, so it is compiled and run once per test variant —
`testInternalDebugUnitTest` *and* `testPublicDebugUnitTest` both execute the same class, and
`BuildConfig.FLAVOR` differs between the two (`"internal"` vs `"public"`). An earlier revision of this
test hardcoded `assertTrue(CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate.isEnabled)`, which only holds for
`internalDebug` and fails outright under `testPublicDebugUnitTest` (`BuildConfig.FLAVOR == "public"` ⇒
the correct, expected gate value is `false`). The fix computes the *expected* value from the same
`BuildConfig` fields the gate itself reads, then asserts the gate agrees — so the same assertion is
correct under both variants without weakening what the gate itself does: the overlay is still compiled
into every variant but only *shown* in `internalDebug` — it never appears in `internalRelease`,
`publicDebug`, or `publicRelease`. No new user-facing setting, developer-options screen, or persistent
preference was added; no existing debug-overlay toggle mechanism exists elsewhere in `:mobile` to reuse
(checked — no `BuildConfig.DEBUG`-gated UI or developer-options screen predates this PR).

### 11.3 Collection — one observable `CameraSessionGeometryObservation`, lifecycle-aware and composition-scoped

**Why not `state` + `debugState()`.** The first revision of this section had `ArScreen` separately
collect `geometryProvider.state` (a `StateFlow<CameraSessionGeometryResult>`) and sample
`geometryProvider.debugState()` (a plain synchronized getter, not a `Flow`) once per recomposition.
That under-notifies a live UI: `StateFlow` never re-emits a *structurally-equal* value, so two
consecutive frames that both produce `IntrinsicsUnavailable(PENDING)` — or two consecutive
`RotationUnavailable` results with the same reason — publish only one `state` emission between them,
even though `observedFrameCount` advanced on the second frame. Compose never recomposes for that
second frame (nothing it collects changed), so the diagnostic overlay's frame/ready counters could sit
stale for the entire time a session stayed in one non-ready category — exactly the situation the
physical-device checklist's stationary/slow-pan/fast-pan tests need live counters for.

**Fix: `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.observation`.** `CameraSessionGeometryProvider.kt` adds:

```kotlin
data class CameraSessionGeometryObservation(
    val result: CameraSessionGeometryResult,
    val debugState: CameraSessionGeometryDebugState,
)

val observation: StateFlow<CameraSessionGeometryObservation>
```

`recomputeLocked()` (the one place that ever changes `result`/counters/latest-status) publishes both
`_state.value` and `_observation.value` from the *same* just-computed `result` and the *same*
post-update counters, in the same locked section, via a shared `debugStateLocked()` helper (also used
by the still-available `debugState()` getter, so the field list is never duplicated). Because
`CameraSessionGeometryObservation` bundles the counters into the value being compared for
`StateFlow`'s equality-based no-op-on-equal-emit behavior, **a counter-only change (same `result`,
advanced `debugState`) still produces a new, distinct `CameraSessionGeometryObservation` and therefore
still emits** — this is what closes the staleness gap above. `dispose()` publishes
`CameraSessionGeometryObservation(result = Disposed, debugState = debugStateLocked())` after counters
are already cleared, under the same lock. `observation` remains bounded, immutable, latest-value-only
— no queue, no history — exactly like `state`/`debugState()` before it. The pre-existing `state`
`StateFlow` is unchanged and still available for any simpler consumer that only needs the result.

**Collection in `ArScreen`.** `ArScreen` collects `geometryProvider.observation` (not `state`, and not
a direct `debugState()` sample) with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` — the same pattern `ArRoute`
already uses for `viewModel.state` (`ArScreen.kt`, both call sites). The collection lives entirely
inside `if (CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate.isEnabled) { ... }` inside the `ArScreen` composable body:
conditional composable calls are fully supported by Compose (unlike hook-order rules in other UI
frameworks), and because the gate's value is fixed for the process lifetime, the branch taken never
changes across recompositions of a given build. No manually launched permanent coroutine, no timer, no
polling loop is used — the underlying collection is scoped to the composition via
`collectAsStateWithLifecycle`'s own `LaunchedEffect`, so it is cancelled the moment `ArScreen` leaves
composition, matching §12's lifecycle requirements. The diagnostic snapshot is built from
`geometryObservation.result.toDiagnosticSnapshot()`; the displayed frame/ready counters are read
directly from `geometryObservation.debugState` — `ArScreen` no longer calls
`geometryProvider.debugState()` for live display. A local `SideEffect` compares the snapshot's
`category` (not the raw observation) across recompositions to maintain a bounded
`statusTransitionCount`: a counter-only observation emission (same category, advanced counters) does
not bump it, since the comparison is on `category`, not on emission identity or count. `ArScreen`
starts no new camera, sensor, resolver, or provider — this is one lifecycle-aware collection of one
existing provider's `observation`, nothing more.

### 11.4 Center-probe (§7)

```kotlin
fun computeCameraGeometryCenterProbe(transform: CropScaleTransform): CameraGeometryCenterProbeSnapshot {
    val viewportCenter = PixelPoint(transform.viewportSize.width / 2.0, transform.viewportSize.height / 2.0)
    val imagePoint = transform.displayToImage(viewportCenter)
    val displayRoundTrip = transform.imageToDisplay(imagePoint)
    val roundTripErrorPx = hypot(displayRoundTrip.x - viewportCenter.x, displayRoundTrip.y - viewportCenter.y)
    ...
}
```

Computed once per `Ready` snapshot (`toDiagnosticSnapshot()` calls it directly on
`geometry.cropScaleTransform`), never per-frame-logged (§10 of the task description; the overlay
*displays* it every recomposition, but nothing logs it). Values are never clamped, and the error is
computed at full `Double` precision before any display rounding — only `buildCameraGeometryDiagnosticText`
rounds, for display, to 1 decimal (image point) / 3 decimals (round-trip error).
`CameraGeometryDiagnosticCenterProbeTest` covers: unrotated, 90°/180°/270° rotation, non-zero crop
origin, and both horizontal- and vertical-center-crop aspect regimes — every case round-trips to
within `1e-6` px. This checks only that the *published* transform is internally self-consistent; per
§9.10/§10.10, it is **not** proof of Preview/ImageAnalysis pixel alignment.

### 11.5 Status/reason mapping and formatting

`CameraGeometryDiagnosticFormat.kt` formats every snapshot field deterministically, always with
`Locale.ROOT` (never the device locale, so a comma-decimal locale cannot change the displayed digits):
pair delta as signed milliseconds with 1 decimal (`"+6.4 ms"` / `"-6.4 ms"`), FOV with 1 decimal per
axis, scale with 3 decimals, offsets with 2 decimals per axis, pixel sizes as `"W×H"`, rotation as
`"D°"`, crop as `"[left,top — right,bottom]"`, and a fixed `"unavailable"` placeholder for every
missing field — never an empty string, never `"null"`, never the sealed result's own `toString()`,
never a rotation matrix or any other pixel-plane value.
`buildCameraGeometryDiagnosticText(snapshot, sessionId, statusTransitionCount, observedFrameCount,
readyBundleCount)` assembles the full multi-line overlay text from these; `CameraGeometryDiagnosticFormatTest`
covers signed/zero/missing pair delta, FOV/scale/offset/pixel-size/rotation/crop formatting and their
missing-field placeholders, the no-scientific-notation guarantee for both ordinary and very large
values, and that the assembled text never contains `"CameraSessionGeometryResult"`,
`"CameraSessionGeometry("`, `"rotationMatrix"`, or `"FloatArray"`.

### 11.6 Overlay UI and session identity

A single non-interactive `Text` composable (`CameraGeometryDiagnosticOverlay`, private, in
`ArScreen.kt`) renders the built text — translucent background, monospace, width-bounded
(`widthIn(max = 280.dp)`), placed at `Alignment.TopStart` with enough top padding to clear the
existing back button. It carries no `clickable`/`pointerInput` modifier, so it never intercepts AR
gestures or camera interaction, and it is rendered as the last element in the top-level `Box` — purely
an overlay layer, never replacing or resizing any existing element. It is shown for every `ArUiState`
(`Loading` and `Ready` alike), since the camera-geometry pipeline itself runs independently of AR
catalog/location loading.

`nextDebugSessionId()` is a private, in-process `AtomicLong` counter (`CameraGeometryDiagnostics.kt`)
incremented via `remember { nextDebugSessionId() }` in `ArScreen` — a fresh value every time a new
`ArScreen` composition is created (i.e. every time AR is re-entered), never persisted, never a device
identifier, never uploaded. Displaying `"session: N"` alongside a bounded `"transitions: N"` counter is
sufficient to prove, from the overlay alone, that leaving and re-entering AR produced a new owner
rather than reusing a disposed one (§12, Test G).

### 11.7 Lifecycle

The diagnostic consumer adds no new lifecycle surface of its own: it reads
`geometryProvider.observation`, owned and disposed exactly as CAM-1f already specifies for `state`
(§10.6) — `dispose()` publishes both from the same locked transition. Because
`collectAsStateWithLifecycle`'s collection is scoped to the `ArScreen` composition (§11.3), it stops
the moment `ArScreen` leaves composition — before, not after, `geometryProvider.dispose()` runs in the
same `DisposableEffect.onDispose` — so no diagnostic recomposition can read from a disposed provider
except to display the terminal `Disposed`/`DISPOSED` category itself (with its counters already
cleared), which is expected and transient. A freshly entered `ArScreen` composition gets a fresh
`remember`ed `geometryProvider` (§10.6, unchanged by this PR) and a fresh `nextDebugSessionId()` value,
so no prior session's frame timestamp, counters, or `Ready` bundle can leak into a new session's first
recomposition.

### 11.8 Confirmation (scope boundaries)

CAM-1g reads **no** pixels, adds **no** YUV/RGB conversion, implements **no** star detection, **no**
matching, **no** pose correction, **no** rotation interpolation, **no** SLERP, and moves **no**
existing star-overlay point. `ArScreen.calculateOverlay()` and `projectionParams(viewport)` are
byte-for-byte unchanged by this PR — the renderer still uses exclusively the legacy fixed
`VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` projection (§3, §10.9). `CameraSessionGeometry.intrinsics`,
`CameraSessionGeometry.pairedRotation`, `CropScaleTransform`, and the center-probe output are read
**only** for display in the diagnostic overlay — none of them feeds `calculateOverlay`,
`projectionParams`, catalog selection (PTSKCAT0/PTSKCAT4 unchanged), or any orientation state. No
`CameraX TransformationInfo` was added. The overlay adds no persistent analytics history and logs no
matrix or raw timestamp stream; it is diagnostic-only and, per §11.2, debug-build-only.

### 11.9 Physical-device validation status

**`CAM-1g BLOCKED ON PHYSICAL DEVICE VALIDATION`** — this PR was authored and tested by a coding agent
with no access to a physical Android device, camera hardware, or rotation sensor; only JVM unit tests
and static review were performed (see the exact command/result log in this PR's description and
`docs/validation/cam_1g_device_validation.md`). The diagnostic overlay, pure mapper, formatting, and
center-probe are implemented and unit-tested exactly as specified, and the full Test A–I checklist
from the task description is transcribed, unexecuted, into
`docs/validation/cam_1g_device_validation.md` for whoever next has a physical device available. Per
§10.10/§9.10, readiness alone (even if it could be observed) would not itself prove
Preview/ImageAnalysis pixel alignment — that still requires a visible marker/grid or a future
detector, out of scope here. This section originally read "CAM-2a (predict-only projection) must not
begin until this device gate has actually been run and reviewed." **Update (CAM-2a):** the task
authorizing CAM-2a explicitly permits it to be implemented as a pure, isolated math slice
notwithstanding this outstanding gate, on the condition that it is not wired into production
rendering and not represented as device-validated — see §12 below. This status line
(`CAM-1g BLOCKED ON PHYSICAL DEVICE VALIDATION`) is otherwise **unchanged**: no physical-device pass
has been run for CAM-1g or CAM-2a.

---

## 12. CAM-2a predict-only star projection pipeline (this PR)

CAM-2a adds a pure, isolated math slice — package `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.prediction`
in `:core:astro-core` — that computes deterministic predicted star positions in camera-normalized,
analyzed-image, and display coordinates from a catalog star's RA/Dec, an observer location/time, and
an existing `CameraSessionGeometry` bundle (CAM-1f), plus a bounded visibility classification. **Full
derivation, conventions, and worked examples live in the focused companion doc,
[`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md`](camera_star_prediction_contract.md)** — this section is
a short pointer plus the essential facts needed to keep this file's own inventory/risk-register
accurate.

**Status:** pure math, unit-tested (388 JVM tests), **not** wired into any renderer or `:mobile` code
path, **not** device-validated. §11.9 above records CAM-1g's own device-gate status as unchanged; the
task authorizing this PR explicitly permits CAM-2a to proceed as an isolated math slice despite that
outstanding gate, provided it stays unwired and unclaimed as device-validated — both of which hold
here.

**What it adds** (all new files, package `.../camera/prediction`):

- `EquatorialStarDirection` / `StarProjectionContext` — pure input types (RA/Dec radians, east-positive
  longitude, absolute UTC instant). Storage is canonical-only: the primary constructor is `private`
  (`@ConsistentCopyVisibility`), so the generated `copy()` cannot bypass normalization either, and the
  sole public entry point is the `of(...)` factory, which wraps RA into `[0, 2π)` and longitude into
  `[-π, π)` before the (also re-validated) `init` block runs.
- `LocalSkyDirection` / `equatorialToLocalSky` — reuses the existing ENU basis
  (`horizontalToVector`'s convention, §1.3 above) and reuses `lstAt`/`raDecToAltAz` verbatim
  (refraction off, per §2 Step A's own recommendation); only the small ENU-embedding arithmetic is
  freshly written, in `Double` for precision.
- `worldToDeviceVector` — applies `pairedRotation`'s **transpose** to a world vector. This traces
  and reconfirms §1.3/§2 Step C's existing "`rotationMatrix` is device→world; `transpose` is
  world→device" fact against the production `RotationFrame`/`ArScreen` code, rather than assuming it.
- `DeviceToOpticalCameraTransform` — the one fixed device→optical sign flip (`+y`/`+z` negated),
  derived from and consistent with the existing (legacy) `projectDeviceVector`'s own sign behavior.
  Its output (`OpticalCameraVector`) is still expressed in the **display-aligned** basis inherited from
  `pairedRotation` (post `remapForDisplay`) — see the next bullet for why that is *not* yet safe to feed
  into the buffer-space pinhole model.
- `DisplayAlignedOpticalToBufferOpticalTransform` — closes a correctness gap found in review of the
  first CAM-2a draft: `pairedRotation` is display-aligned (`+x`/`+y` = display-right/display-up for
  whatever the display's current rotation happens to be), but the pinhole model projects into the
  **native, unrotated analysis buffer**, and `CropScaleTransform.imageToDisplay` then applies its own
  forward rotation by `frame.rotationDegrees`. Feeding a display-aligned ray straight into the pinhole
  model — the first draft's bug — silently double-applies rotation for `rotationDegrees ∈ {90, 270}`
  (once implicitly via the attitude, once explicitly via `CropScaleTransform`). This transform is the
  **one** explicit, pure correction for that mismatch — a 2D change of basis around the optical Z axis
  only, derived as the exact inverse of `CropScaleTransform`'s own private `rotateClockwise` Jacobian
  (not guessed) — producing a distinct `BufferOpticalCameraVector` type so the two bases can never be
  silently mixed again. Depth (`z`) is untouched. See
  `docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §4.5 for the full derivation, mapping table, and coupled
  attitude/frame-rotation test design.
- `CameraDirectionProjection` / `PinholeProjectionModel` — pinhole projection using **real**
  intrinsics-derived focal length (`fx = width / (2·tan(hFov/2))`, likewise `fy`) into the **unrotated
  full analyzed-buffer** coordinate space, with `CropScaleTransform.imageToDisplay` (already existing,
  CAM-1e) doing the one-and-only rotation. `forGeometry` now requires the resolved intrinsics'
  `reference` to be a `CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer` (see the next bullet) whose
  `widthPx`/`heightPx` **exactly** equal `geometry.frame`'s buffer dimensions, and throws otherwise —
  it is no longer possible for a physical-sensor-referenced calibrated FOV, a dimensionless fallback,
  or an analysis-buffer-referenced value resolved for a *different* buffer/session to be silently
  applied as if it matched this one.
- `CameraIntrinsicsReference` (`AnalysisBuffer(widthPx, heightPx)` / `PhysicalSensor` / `Unspecified`)
  — a second correctness gap, hardened twice: `CameraIntrinsics` (CAM-1b) derives FOV from
  `SENSOR_INFO_PHYSICAL_SIZE` + focal length with no active-array/crop-region reasoning at all
  (confirmed by inspecting `CameraIntrinsicsResolver.kt`), so a `CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS`-sourced
  (calibrated) intrinsics value describes the **physical sensor**, not necessarily the `ImageAnalysis`
  buffer CameraX may have cropped/scaled it into — a mapping this codebase captures no metadata for.
  The first fix derived an `ANALYSIS_BUFFER`/`PHYSICAL_SENSOR` label purely from `source`
  (`LEGACY_FALLBACK` → always "safe"), which review found insufficient: `legacyFallbackCameraIntrinsics`
  can be constructed with no dimensions, with dimensions from a different buffer/session, or with a
  different aspect ratio, then reused against an arbitrary `CameraSessionGeometry` — deriving "safe"
  from `source` alone cannot detect any of that, recreating the exact dimensionless/stale-aspect
  fallback bug CAM-1f's own coordinator prevents, just one layer higher. `CameraIntrinsicsReference` is
  now **caller-supplied data**, not derived from `source`: `AnalysisBuffer` carries its own
  `widthPx`/`heightPx` so a consumer can check them against the real buffer, `PhysicalSensor` means no
  analysis-buffer mapping is known at all, and `Unspecified` means no reference dimensions were ever
  available (e.g. a fallback resolved before the first analyzed frame). `CameraIntrinsics.init` still
  enforces the one cross-field rule production must uphold (`CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS`/
  `CAMERA_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION` ⇒ `PhysicalSensor`; `LEGACY_FALLBACK` ⇒ `AnalysisBuffer` or
  `Unspecified`) as defense in depth, without pretending `AnalysisBuffer`'s actual dimensions are
  implied by `source`. `projectStars` checks `reference` **before** ever constructing a
  `PinholeProjectionModel` and returns a categorized
  `StarPredictionBatchResult.IntrinsicsMappingUnavailable(reason)` — `PHYSICAL_SENSOR_REFERENCE_SPACE_UNSUPPORTED`,
  `ANALYSIS_BUFFER_REFERENCE_MISSING`, or `ANALYSIS_BUFFER_DIMENSIONS_MISMATCH` — instead of fabricating
  a buffer-space FOV or silently reusing a mismatched one.
- `StarPredictionBatchResult` — sealed result (`Ready(projections)` /
  `IntrinsicsMappingUnavailable(reason)`) so "the calibrated intrinsics can't be mapped to this buffer"
  is a distinct, explicit, typed outcome rather than an exception or a silently-degraded projection.
  `Ready`'s primary constructor is `private`; the sole public path, `Ready.of(...)`, stores a defensive
  copy of its input list, so a caller cannot mutate an already-returned `Ready` result through a
  reference to the (possibly mutable) list it originally passed in.
- `PredictedStarProjection` / `PredictedStarClassification` — a bounded result distinguishing
  behind-camera, outside-crop, inside-crop-but-outside-viewport, and visible, carrying no rotation
  matrix, catalog object, or Android type. `init` enforces there is no public "impossible" state:
  `cameraDirection`/`imagePoint`/`displayPoint` are all `null` for `BEHIND_CAMERA` and all non-null for
  every other classification — enforced, not just documented, so no construction or `copy()` path can
  produce a mismatched combination. `CameraDirectionSnapshot`'s five scalars are each validated finite.
- `StarPredictionSummary` — every count is validated non-negative, and the four classification counts'
  sum (computed in `Long`, so four `Int`-range counts near `Int.MAX_VALUE` cannot wrap around into a
  value that coincidentally matches `inputCount`) must equal it exactly.
- `StarProjectionContext.magneticDeclinationRad` / `trueEnuToMagneticEnu` — a third correctness fix,
  independent of the two above: `equatorialToLocalSky` produces a **true**-north ENU vector (pure
  astronomy), but `geometry.pairedRotation.rotationMatrix` is the *raw* device→world matrix from
  `SensorManager.getRotationMatrixFromVector` — **magnetic**-north-referenced (§1.3's own "North
  caveat"; R3 below) — captured *before* the legacy renderer's separate, later
  `RotationFrame.correctedForTrueNorth(declinationDeg)` call, which only ever corrects the matrix used
  to build its own `trueNorthFrame` for pixel math, never the matrix fed into CAM-1d's rotation-sample
  history. Feeding a true-north sky vector straight into that raw matrix silently rotated every
  predicted star's azimuth by the local magnetic declination (which can exceed 10°) — this is R3,
  previously tracked only for the legacy renderer, recreated in CAM-2a's own pipeline.
  `magneticDeclinationRad` (east-positive, exactly `android.hardware.GeomagneticField.getDeclination()`'s
  and `correctedForTrueNorth`'s own sign convention) is now an explicit pure input on
  `StarProjectionContext`, defaulting to `0.0` — an explicit "treat magnetic north as true north" mode,
  never a claim that the real declination is zero — and `trueEnuToMagneticEnu` is the one explicit
  correction, applied once, immediately before `worldToDeviceVector`, derived as the exact algebraic
  inverse of `correctedForTrueNorth`'s own matrix math (see
  `docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §4.6 for the full derivation and equivalence proof, the
  latter checked against both a ported reimplementation of that algebra (`:core:astro-core`, which
  cannot depend on `:mobile` to call the real function) and the actual production function itself
  (`:mobile`'s `RotationFrameTrueNorthEquivalenceTest`). CAM-2a still cannot compute a real
  declination itself (no `GeomagneticField` call, no Android dependency) — that remains a future
  mobile-integration responsibility, unimplemented here.
- `projectStars(stars, context, geometry)` — the pure, stateless, order-preserving batch API; plus
  `summarizeStarPredictions` for a bounded count-only summary.

**What it explicitly does not add:** pixel reads, a detector/matcher, pose correction, rotation
interpolation/SLERP, any renderer change, or any new `CameraSessionGeometryProvider` producer/consumer
in `:mobile`. `ArScreen.calculateOverlay()`/`projectionParams(viewport)`/`VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` are
byte-for-byte unchanged. `projectStars` is still not called from `ArScreen` or anywhere in `:mobile`
production code, and `:core:astro-core` still takes no Android/hardware dependency (no
`GeomagneticField` call, no sensor ownership) — the caller must always supply
`magneticDeclinationRad` itself.

**Risk register additions** — see `docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §11 for detail: the
pinhole model's unrotated-buffer coordinate space and the IMU-derived device frame are not verified
co-registered on a real device (same unresolved class of risk as R8 below); camera-to-IMU extrinsic
offset and lens distortion remain unmodeled, matching CAM-1's own deferred scope (§3.3). The
display-aligned/buffer-optical basis mismatch (R12) and the physical-sensor/analysis-buffer intrinsics
mismatch (R13) are both now closed **at the pure-math level** by the transform and the
`CameraIntrinsicsReference` exact-dimension check above — see R12/R13 in Appendix A — but neither of
those fixes is itself device-validated; they are internally-consistent-by-construction, not confirmed
against real hardware. R12's own tests are explicitly **self-consistent basis-composition tests**, not
a model of CameraX's real sensor-orientation/rotation-reporting behavior (see
`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §11's first bullet) — they do not model
`CameraCharacteristics.SENSOR_ORIENTATION` or how CameraX derives `ImageProxy.imageInfo.rotationDegrees`
from it, so they cannot and do not claim to reproduce "the real production relationship." R3
("Magnetic vs true North") is likewise now closed for CAM-2a's own pipeline at the pure-math level by
`trueEnuToMagneticEnu` — this does not verify a *given* caller-supplied `magneticDeclinationRad` is the
actual correct value for a real place/time (CAM-2a has no way to check that; see
`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §11's dedicated bullet), only that CAM-2a's own algebra,
given a declination, treats it exactly as the legacy renderer's already-accepted `correctedForTrueNorth`
does.

## 13. CAM-2b debug-only predicted-star overlay consumer (this PR)

CAM-2a (§12) produced `PredictedStarProjection` values but nothing consumed them. CAM-2b adds the
**first** consumer — an `internalDebug`-only diagnostic overlay inside `ArScreen` — so the CAM-2a
pipeline can finally be visually cross-checked against the legacy renderer and, eventually, against a
physical device. This is the CAM-2a §12 "next slice" described there, now implemented. **Full
derivation, adapter/reducer design, and the physical-device checklist live in the focused companion
doc, [`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md`](camera_star_prediction_contract.md) §14** — this
section is a short pointer plus the essential facts needed to keep this file's own inventory/risk
register accurate.

**Status:** implemented and JVM-unit-tested, **not** device-validated. Mirrors CAM-1g's/CAM-2a's own
status lines (§11.9, §12): a coding agent authored and tested this with no physical Android device,
camera hardware, or rotation sensor available.

**What it adds** (`:mobile`, package `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera.prediction`, plus two small
Compose additions in `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar`):

- A bounded catalog adapter (`selectPredictedStarDirections`) that converts the phone's own
  visibility-selected `StarRecord` prefix (the same filter `ArScreen.calculateOverlay` already applies,
  now shared via `visibilitySelectedStars`) into `EquatorialStarDirection`, bounded to
  `PREDICTED_STAR_OVERLAY_MAX_INPUT_STARS = 200` brightest-first entries, keyed by each star's stable
  catalog id — never the full ~42k-star catalog, never a second catalog parser, never sorting inside
  CAM-2a itself.
- A pure reducer (`reducePredictedStarOverlayState`) that gates on the same `internalDebug` flavor check
  CAM-1g already established (`CameraGeometryDiagnosticsGate`/`isDiagnosticsEnabled` — reused directly,
  not a second inconsistent flavor check), maps every non-`Ready` `CameraSessionGeometryResult` and
  every `IntrinsicsMappingUnavailableReason` to a specific typed `PredictedStarOverlayWaitingReason`/
  the reason itself, and otherwise calls `projectStars(...)` with the **raw**, still magnetic-north-
  referenced `CameraSessionGeometry` CAM-1f/1g already publish — never a matrix pre-corrected via
  `RotationFrame.correctedForTrueNorth` — plus the legacy renderer's own already-computed
  `GeomagneticField` declination as `StarProjectionContext.magneticDeclinationRad`. Passing both a
  corrected matrix and a non-zero context declination would double-correct true north (§12's own R3);
  the reducer's KDoc makes this ownership split explicit, and a dedicated unit test cross-checks the
  reducer's output against an independent `projectStars` call over the same raw geometry.
- A bounded, immutable UI state (`PredictedStarOverlayState`: `Disabled`/`Waiting`/`Ready`/
  `Unavailable`) built once per coherent recomputation via Compose `remember`, keyed on the geometry
  observation, observer location/time, declination, and the bounded star subset — never a polling loop,
  never a permanently launched coroutine, never an unbounded queue.
- Two small Compose additions (`PredictedStarMarkersCanvas`, `PredictedStarOverlayPanel`,
  `PredictedStarOverlayControls`) that draw only `VISIBLE_IN_VIEWPORT` predictions, anchored exactly at
  CAM-2a's own `displayPoint` with no further scale/rotation/offset, in a fixed cyan
  hollow-circle-plus-cross style deliberately distinct from the legacy `BvColor` star dots — drawn on
  top of the existing legacy overlay, never replacing it — plus a compact status panel and a
  session-local (non-persisted) pair of toggles.

**What it explicitly does not add:** pixel reads, a detector/matcher, pose correction, rotation
interpolation/SLERP, any change to `ArScreen.calculateOverlay()`/`projectionParams(viewport)`/
`VERTICAL_FOV_DEG = 56.0` (all byte-for-byte unchanged), any new `CameraSessionGeometryProvider`
instance (CAM-2b reuses the exact provider/observation `ArScreen` already collects for CAM-1g), any
catalog asset or parser change, or physical-sensor intrinsics support (CAM-2a's
`PHYSICAL_SENSOR_REFERENCE_SPACE_UNSUPPORTED` gate is unchanged and still surfaces as a categorized
`Unavailable` state, never a fabricated projection).

**Risk register addition** — see Appendix A, R14: the predicted-marker/legacy-overlay visual comparison
this slice enables is itself unverified on real hardware; every risk CAM-2a already carried (R3, R11,
R12, R13) is unchanged and still open.

| # | Risk | Where | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Azimuth clockwise-from-North vs math CCW | Steps A/B | cardinal-table test (§6.4) |
| R2 | Refraction on in one direction, off in the other | `raDecToAltAz` vs `altAzToRaDec` | fix one convention (§2 Step A) |
| R3 | Magnetic vs true North | `correctedForTrueNorth` | declination-offset test (§6.4); CAM-2a's own pipeline closes this at the pure-math level via `StarProjectionContext.magneticDeclinationRad` / `trueEnuToMagneticEnu`, proven algebraically equivalent to `correctedForTrueNorth` (`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §4.6) — not a claim that a caller-supplied declination is itself correct, and not device-validated |
| R4 | Camera axis is device `−Z` | `forwardWorld` negation | reticle round-trip test (§2 Step C) |
| R5 | Display remap vs image `rotationDegrees` double-count | `remapForDisplay` + analyzer | per-rotation test (§6.3) |
| R6 | Screen/image Y flip (`1 − ndcY`) | `projectDeviceVector` | centre + edge test (§6.2) |
| R7 | Wrong/hardcoded FOV → scale error | `projectionParams` | FOV-scaling test (§6.5) |
| R8 | `FILL_CENTER` crop ignored (image ≠ viewport aspect) | `CameraPreview` + Step E | crop/scale test (§6.5); pure `CropScaleTransform` forward/inverse + visibility tests (§9, CAM-1e) — not yet wired/device-validated |
| R9 | Front-camera mirroring | (back camera only today) | flip guard if front added |
| R10 | Sensor/camera clock base mismatch | §4 sync | age gate + near-still fallback (§4.3); measured nearest-sample pairing + tolerance/mismatch thresholds + diagnostic compatibility status, not yet device-validated (§4.5) |
| R11 | `pairedRotation`'s device frame vs. the pinhole model's unrotated-buffer pixel grid may not be co-registered on a real device | CAM-2a `PinholeProjectionModel`/`worldToDeviceVector` | traced (not guessed) transpose direction + literal-matrix tests (§12, `docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §4/§11) — pure math only, not yet device-validated |
| R12 | Display-aligned optical ray fed directly into the buffer-space pinhole model double-applies rotation for `rotationDegrees ∈ {90, 270}` | CAM-2a `DisplayAlignedOpticalToBufferOpticalTransform` | one explicit inverse-basis transform, derived from `CropScaleTransform.rotateClockwise`'s own Jacobian; coupled attitude/`frame.rotationDegrees` tests for all four rotations (`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §4.5) — closed at the pure-math/internal-consistency level, not device-validated |
| R13 | A physical-sensor-referenced calibrated FOV (`CameraIntrinsics`) silently assumed to describe the `ImageAnalysis` buffer, when CameraX may have cropped/scaled the sensor into that buffer; and (hardened further) an analysis-buffer-referenced FOV resolved for one buffer/session silently reused against a different, dimensionless, or differently-sized buffer | CAM-2a `PinholeProjectionModel.forGeometry` / `CameraIntrinsicsReference` | `CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer` carries its own `widthPx`/`heightPx` as data, not merely a source-derived label; `forGeometry` requires an exact width/height match against `geometry.frame`'s buffer (aspect-ratio match alone is not accepted) and throws otherwise; `projectStars` checks this first and returns a categorized `StarPredictionBatchResult.IntrinsicsMappingUnavailable` (`PHYSICAL_SENSOR_REFERENCE_SPACE_UNSUPPORTED` / `ANALYSIS_BUFFER_REFERENCE_MISSING` / `ANALYSIS_BUFFER_DIMENSIONS_MISMATCH`) instead of fabricating, silently downgrading, or reusing a stale/mismatched reference (`docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §6.2) |
| R14 | CAM-2b's predicted-marker overlay visually implies alignment with the legacy renderer/real sky, but the comparison itself is not yet verified on real hardware — every upstream risk it depends on (R3, R11, R12, R13) is unchanged and still open | CAM-2b `ArScreen` predicted-star overlay | JVM-tested reducer/adapter only; physical-device checklist transcribed, unexecuted, into `docs/validation/cam_2b_device_validation.md` (§13, `docs/camera_star_prediction_contract.md` §14) |
