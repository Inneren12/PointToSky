    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Point-to-Sky processes all astronomy and sensor data on your device. We do not operate servers for this app and we do not collect personal data.</p>

    <h2>Data we access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> – used to calculate the visible part of the sky and suggest objects near you.</li>
        <li><strong>Device sensors</strong> (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, light sensor) – used to orient the sky map and augmented reality overlays.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> – used to display the augmented reality view on phones that support it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These signals are processed in memory only. We do not copy them outside of the application, we do not build profiles, and we do not share the data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Storage and retention</h2>
    <p>Configuration preferences (for example, manual coordinates or settings toggles) are stored locally on the device. They can be cleared at any time by removing the app.</p>

    <h2>Crash and analytics data</h2>
    <p>The S9.C release does not include crash reporting or analytics. If a later build enables services such as Firebase Crashlytics, we will update this page to describe which diagnostic data leaves the device and how to opt out.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about privacy, contact the maintainers at <a href="mailto:privacy@pointtosky.dev">privacy@pointtosky.dev</a>.</p>
