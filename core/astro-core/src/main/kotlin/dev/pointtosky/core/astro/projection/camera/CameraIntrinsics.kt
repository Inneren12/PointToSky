 * was insufficient: [legacyFallbackCameraIntrinsics] can be — and in tests routinely was —
 * constructed without image dimensions, with dimensions from a different buffer/session, or with a
 * different aspect ratio, then reused against an arbitrary [dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.CameraSessionGeometry].

 * just one layer higher, at the CAM-2a boundary. [CameraIntrinsicsReference] fixes this by making
 * the reference **carry its own dimensions** when it claims to be analysis-buffer-referenced, so a

/**
 * A plain, Android-independent camera intrinsics contract.

 * This is a data contract only — CAM-1b introduces it and a resolver in `:mobile` capable of
 * populating it from real device metadata, but the AR renderer still calls the legacy
 * `projectionParams(viewport)` (see [dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.projectionParams]).
 * Nothing here is wired into rendering yet.
 *
 * All values are validated eagerly: invalid device metadata must be rejected here, not silently
 * clamped. Both FOVs must be finite and satisfy `0 < fov < 180`. The optional physical dimensions
 * ([focalLengthMm], [sensorWidthMm], [sensorHeightMm]) must be finite and strictly positive when
 * present — a physical dimension can never be zero. The optional principal-point image coordinates
 * ([principalPointXPx], [principalPointYPx]) must be finite and non-negative when present — an
 * image-coordinate axis legitimately starts at pixel `0`, so unlike the physical dimensions they
 * are not required to be strictly positive. Callers that read from potentially-malformed Camera2
 * metadata are expected to catch the resulting [IllegalArgumentException] and fall back to
 * [CameraIntrinsicsSource.LEGACY_FALLBACK] themselves.
 *
 * [reference] and [source] are independent fields describing different things (see
 * [CameraIntrinsicsReference]'s KDoc) but are not independently *free*: `init` below re-validates
 * the one cross-field consistency rule production code must uphold (defense in depth, matching this

 * no recorded crop/scale mapping to any buffer — still rejected exactly as before by
 * [dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.prediction.PinholeProjectionModel.forGeometry]/
 * `projectStars`, which gate on [reference] alone and were not changed) **or**
 * [CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer] (CAM-2c: the same real Camera2 metadata, but mapped
 * through the exact CameraX sensor-to-buffer transform for one analyzed frame — see
 * `dev.pointtosky.mobile.ar.camera.resolveAnalysisBufferIntrinsics`); and
 * [CameraIntrinsicsSource.LEGACY_FALLBACK] must carry [CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer] or
 * [CameraIntrinsicsReference.Unspecified]. This does **not** mean [reference] is derived from
 * [source] — an [CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer]'s [CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer.widthPx]/
 * `heightPx` are still caller-supplied data with no relationship to `source` at all; the rule above
 * only rules out the specific mislabelings this hardening exists to prevent (a physical-sensor-only
 * measurement — [CameraIntrinsicsSource.CAMERA_INTRINSIC_CALIBRATION] — claiming to be
 * analysis-buffer-safe, or a legacy fallback claiming to be physical-sensor-referenced).
 *
 * [quality] is a third, also-independent field: non-`null` only for
 * [CameraIntrinsicsSource.CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS] (either [reference] variant), `null` for every
 * other source — see [CameraIntrinsicsQuality]'s KDoc.
 *
 * [axisSwapped]/[negateXInput]/[negateYInput] (CAM-2c fix §1/§2) record how the real Camera2
 * `SENSOR_INFO_ACTIVE_ARRAY_SIZE`-to-buffer position mapping (a
 * `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.SensorToBufferMatrix3`, classified by
 * `classifySensorToBufferMatrix`) related active-array pixel axes to this buffer's own pixel axes,
 * whenever that relationship was anything other than the identity-like `AXIS_ALIGNED_0` case. All
 * three default to `false` (the [CameraIntrinsicsSource.LEGACY_FALLBACK]/pre-CAM-2c-fix behavior) and
 * are only ever non-default for [CameraIntrinsicsSource.CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS] values referencing
 * [CameraIntrinsicsReference.AnalysisBuffer] — see
 * `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.prediction.PinholeProjectionModel`'s KDoc for exactly
 * how [dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.prediction.PinholeProjectionModel.forGeometry] wires
 * these into [dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.prediction.PinholeProjectionModel.project],
 * and for the proof that this can never double up with the separate, untouched
 * `frame.rotationDegrees`-driven ray-direction rotation.
 *
 * @property horizontalFovDeg full horizontal field of view, degrees, `0 < fov < 180`.
 * @property verticalFovDeg full vertical field of view, degrees, `0 < fov < 180`.
 * @property focalLengthMm physical focal length in millimetres, when known. Finite and strictly

 * @property sensorHeightMm physical sensor height in millimetres, when known. Finite and strictly

 *   [CameraIntrinsicsSource.CAMERA_CHARACTERISTICS].

 *   came out negative before sign-normalization (see
 *   `dev.pointtosky.core.astro.projection.camera.mapActiveArrayIntrinsicsThroughMatrix`), meaning the
